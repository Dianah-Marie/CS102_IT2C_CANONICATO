"1","Rethinking Autoencoders for Medical Anomaly Detection from A Theoretical Perspective","Yu Cai, Hao Chen, Kwang-Ting Cheng","Machine Learning (cs.LG)","Medical anomaly detection aims to identify abnormal findings using only normal training data, playing a crucial role in health screening and recognizing rare diseases. Reconstruction-based methods, particularly those utilizing autoencoders (AEs), are dominant in this field. They work under the assumption that AEs trained on only normal data cannot reconstruct unseen abnormal regions well, thereby enabling the anomaly detection based on reconstruction errors. However, this assumption does not always hold due to the mismatch between the reconstruction training objective and the anomaly detection task objective, rendering these methods theoretically unsound. This study focuses on providing a theoretical foundation for AE-based reconstruction methods in anomaly detection. By leveraging information theory, we elucidate the principles of these methods and reveal that the key to improving AE in anomaly detection lies in minimizing the information entropy of latent vectors. Experiments on four datasets with two image modalities validate the effectiveness of our theory. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort to theoretically clarify the principles and design philosophy of AE for anomaly detection. Code will be available upon acceptance.","Thu, 14 Mar 2024 11:51:01 UTC (205 KB)"

Here, we describe a selection of notable activities conducted by the named Chairs of Physics during the period 1845-1970. We uncover a long tradition of major contributions to physics education and research, including the production of highly regarded physics textbooks that were widely used in Europe, as well as pioneering contributions to electron diffraction and microscopy, Fourier optics, and holography. These discoveries yield valuable insights into the historical development of physics research in France, and show how even a small provincial university was able to stay up-to-date with international developments across several areas of physics.","Thu, 14 Mar 2024 10:47:25 UTC (4,636 KB)"

Leaving no doubt regarding its heuristic value, we argue that a view of the metric field of GR as nothing but a stand-in for a self-coupling field in flat spacetime runs into a dilemma: either the view is physically incomplete in so far as it requires recourse to GR after all, or it leads to an absurd multiplication of alternative viewpoints on GR rendering any understanding of the metric field as nothing but a spin-2 field in flat spacetime unjustified.","Wed, 13 Mar 2024 15:50:26 UTC (14 KB)"
"4","What would Plato say? Concepts and notions from Greek philosophy applied to gamification mechanics for a meaningful and ethical gamification","Kostas Karpouzis","Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC)","Gamification, the integration of game mechanics in non-game settings, has become increasingly prevalent in various digital platforms; however, its ethical and societal impacts are often overlooked. This paper delves into how Platonic and Aristotelian philosophies can provide a critical framework for understanding and evaluating the ethical dimensions of gamification. Plato's allegory of the cave and theory of forms are used to analyse the perception of reality in gamified environments, questioning their authenticity and the value of virtual achievements, while Aristotle's virtue ethics, with its emphasis on moderation, virtue, and eudaimonia (true and full happiness), can help assess how gamification influences user behaviour and ethical decision-making. The paper critically examines various gamification elements, such as the hero's journey, altruistic actions, badge levels, and user autonomy, through these philosophical lenses, and addresses the ethical responsibilities of gamification designers, advocating for a balanced approach that prioritizes user well-being and ethical development over commercial interests. By bridging ancient philosophical insights with modern digital culture, this research contributes to a deeper understanding of the ethical implications of gamification, emphasizing the need for responsible and virtuous design in digital applications.","Tue, 12 Mar 2024 19:25:13 UTC (802 KB)"
"5","Navigating the Quantum Divide(s)","A. Ayda Gercek, Zeki C. Seskir","Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph)","This article explores the possible divides resulting from the introduction of emerging quantum technologies (QT) to society. It provides the multidirectional impacts of QT on science, technology, geopolitics, and societal structures. We aim to challenge the idea of a singular ""quantum divide"" by presenting a more comprehensive perspective. To complement the existing literature on the quantum divide, we propose four distinct divides that could result from the emergence of QT. Firstly, we examine the ""Quantum Divide in Science"", representing the paradigmatic gap among scientists and inequalities in access to knowledge/resources within research communities. We suggest the ""Quantum Divide in Technologies through Path-dependency"" as the second possible divide, examining the adoption processes of certain technologies to be developed by nations, firms, and research communities. The discussion extends internationally, focusing on the ""Quantum Divide between Countries,"" by dealing with the reasons and outcomes of the adoption processes between countries of different development levels (economically, industrially, and technologically). As the final divide, we put forth our perspective on the ""Quantum Divide within Societies"", one of the most explored ones in the literature, addressing societal implications. For each type of the divide, we propose several directions to navigate them, some complementary, some incompatible. Finally, we discuss the interconnectedness and distinctness of different types of divides and how they impact the directions to navigate them. This study serves as a guidance for those interested in a more in-depth investigation of the concept of quantum divide, possible directions of navigating the divides, and how the introduction of QT might affect the innovation ecosystems by impacting the scientific, technological, international, and societal institutions.","Tue, 12 Mar 2024 19:10:02 UTC (487 KB)"

Feature extraction is performed at different scales by a U-Net encoder-decoder network and the feature aggregation of those features into a single descriptor is carried out by a Generalized Mean Pooling (GeM). The proposed architecture demonstrates that it is possible to surpass the current state-of-the-art by only relying on conventional 3D sparse convolutions without making use of more complex and sophisticated proposals such as Transformers, Attention-Layers or Deformable Convolutions. A thorough assessment of the proposal has been carried out using the Oxford RobotCar and the In-house datasets. As a result, MinkUNeXt proves to outperform other methods in the state-of-the-art.","Tue, 12 Mar 2024 12:25:54 UTC (2,333 KB)[v2] Wed, 13 Mar 2024 09:39:14 UTC (2,333 KB)"

These solutions often repurpose deep learning models from other domains, such as vision, text, and graph analytics, applying them to circuit design without tailoring to the unique complexities of electronic circuits. Such an AI4EDA approach falls short of achieving a holistic design synthesis and understanding, overlooking the intricate interplay of electrical, logical, and physical facets of circuit data. This perspective paper argues for a paradigm shift from AI4EDA towards AI-native EDA, integrating AI at the core of the design process. Pivotal to this vision is the development of a multimodal circuit representation learning technique, poised to provide a comprehensive understanding by harmonizing and extracting insights from varied data sources, such as functional specifications, RTL designs, circuit netlists, and physical layouts. We champion the creation of large circuit models (LCMs) that are inherently multimodal, crafted to decode and express the rich semantics and structures of circuit data, thus fostering more resilient, efficient, and inventive design methodologies. Embracing this AI-native philosophy, we foresee a trajectory that transcends the current innovation plateau in EDA, igniting a profound shift-left in electronic design methodology. The envisioned advancements herald not just an evolution of existing EDA tools but a revolution, giving rise to novel instruments of design-tools that promise to radically enhance design productivity and inaugurate a new epoch where the optimization of circuit performance, power, and area (PPA) is achieved not incrementally, but through leaps that redefine the benchmarks of electronic systems' capabilities.","Tue, 12 Mar 2024 02:26:30 UTC (1,615 KB)"
"9","On the stochastics of human and artificial creativity","Solve Sæbø, Helge Brovold","Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)","What constitutes human creativity, and is it possible for computers to exhibit genuine creativity? We argue that achieving human-level intelligence in computers, or so-called Artificial General Intelligence, necessitates attaining also human-level creativity. We contribute to this discussion by developing a statistical representation of human creativity, incorporating prior insights from stochastic theory, psychology, philosophy, neuroscience, and chaos theory. This highlights the stochastic nature of the human creative process, which includes both a bias guided, random proposal step, and an evaluation step depending on a flexible or transformable bias structure. The acquired representation of human creativity is subsequently used to assess the creativity levels of various contemporary AI systems. Our analysis includes modern AI algorithms such as reinforcement learning, diffusion models, and large language models, addressing to what extent they measure up to human level creativity. We conclude that these technologies currently lack the capability for autonomous creative action at a human level.","Sun, 3 Mar 2024 10:38:57 UTC (27,634 KB)"

Let $C/k$ be a projective smooth curve with function field $K=k(C)$ and $G/k$ be a connected reductive group. Let $F$ be a principal $G$-bundle on $C$. Let $P \subseteq G$ be a parabolic subgroup and $\lambda: P \longrightarrow G$ be a strictly anti-dominant character. Then $F/P \longrightarrow C$ is a flag bundle and $\mathcal{L}_\lambda=F \times_P k_\lambda$ on $F/P$ is a relatively ample line bundle. Let $h_{\mathcal{L}_\lambda}$ be the height function on $X=(F/P)_K$ induced by $\mathcal{L}_\lambda$. We compute its height filtration and successive minima: the height filtration is given by a Bruhat decomposition and successive minima are given by slopes. An interesting application is that, in this case, Zhang's inequality on successive minima can be enhanced into an equality. This is proved from the convex geometry point of view. Let $f \in N^1(F/P)$ be the numerical class of a vertical fiber. We also compute the augmented base loci $\mathrm{B}_+(\mathcal{L}_\lambda-tf)$ for any $t \in \mathbb{R}$ and it turns out that they are almost the same as the height filtration, which accords with the philosophy in Arakelov geometry that the positivity of the line bundle $\mathcal{L}_\lambda$ is equivalent to the positivity of its induced height function $h_{\mathcal{L}_\lambda}$. As a corollary, we compute the $k$-th movable cones of flag bundles over curves for all $k$.","Mon, 11 Mar 2024 15:26:54 UTC (30 KB)"
"11","From S-matrix theory to strings: Scattering data and the commitment to non-arbitrariness","Robert van Leeuwen","History and Philosophy of Physics (physics.hist-ph)","The early history of string theory is marked by a shift from strong interaction physics to quantum gravity. The first string models and associated theoretical framework were formulated in the late 1960s and early 1970s in the context of the S-matrix program for the strong interactions. In the mid-1970s, the models were reinterpreted as a potential theory unifying the four fundamental forces. This paper provides a historical analysis of how string theory was developed out of S-matrix physics, aiming to clarify how modern string theory, as a theory detached from experimental data, grew out of an S-matrix program that was strongly dependent upon observable quantities. Surprisingly, the theoretical practice of physicists already turned away from experiment before string theory was recast as a potential unified quantum gravity theory. With the formulation of dual resonance models (the ""hadronic string theory""), physicists were able to determine almost all of the models' parameters on the basis of theoretical reasoning. It was this commitment to ""non-arbitrariness"", i.e., a lack of free parameters in the theory, that initially drove string theorists away from experimental input, and not the practical inaccessibility of experimental data in the context of quantum gravity physics. This is an important observation when assessing the role of experimental data in string theory.","Mon, 11 Mar 2024 13:05:08 UTC (712 KB)"
"12","Unexpected Quantum Indeterminacy","Andrea Oldofredi","History and Philosophy of Physics (physics.hist-ph)","Recent philosophical discussions about metaphysical indeterminacy have been substantiated with the idea that quantum mechanics, one of the most successful physical theories in the history of science, provides explicit instances of worldly indefiniteness. Against this background, several philosophers underline that there are alternative formulations of quantum theory in which such indeterminacy has no room and plays no role. A typical example is Bohmian mechanics in virtue of its clear particle ontology. Contrary to these latter claims, this paper aims at showing that different pilot-wave theories do in fact instantiate diverse forms of metaphysical indeterminacy. Namely, I argue that there are various questions about worldly states of affairs that cannot be determined by looking exclusively at their ontologies and dynamical laws. Moreover, it will be claimed that Bohmian mechanics generates a new form of modal indeterminacy. Finally, it will be concluded that ontological clarity and indeterminacy are not mutually exclusive, i.e., the two can coexist in the same theory.","Mon, 11 Mar 2024 10:30:09 UTC (58 KB)"

He had been the sole professor of Physics at the University of Perugia for thirty years. With this brief contribution we intend to repay a debt of gratitude, first of all because his scientific merits were probably underestimated, having spent the first fifteen years of his career under the shadow of the great Augusto Righi in Bologna, where he also witnessed meetings with the young Marconi. He was then relegated to the Faculty of Medicine of Perugia, without a real laboratory, disregarded by the national scientific community and unable to move to better equipped locations. Nevertheless, he proved to be a gifted teacher and popularizer of science. He published a comprehensive three-volume physics textbook that was widely used in Italy and abroad. Despite becoming an Italian citizen in 1894, Dessau's German origins led to his suspension from service during World War I. Furthermore, his Jewish identity made him a target of Nazi-fascist antisemitism. He was dismissed from both the University of Perugia and from the Italian Society of Physics, of which he had been a member since its beginning, fortunately escaping deportation.","Sun, 10 Mar 2024 07:11:27 UTC (3,012 KB)"

"16","And Then the Hammer Broke: Reflections on Machine Ethics from Feminist Philosophy of Science","Andre Ye","Computers and Society (cs.CY)","Vision is an important metaphor in ethical and political questions of knowledge. The feminist philosopher Donna Haraway points out the ``perverse'' nature of an intrusive, alienating, all-seeing vision (to which we might cry out ``stop looking at me!''), but also encourages us to embrace the embodied nature of sight and its promises for genuinely situated knowledge. Current technologies of machine vision -- surveillance cameras, drones (for war or recreation), iPhone cameras -- are usually construed as instances of the former rather than the latter, and for good reasons. However, although in no way attempting to diminish the real suffering these technologies have brought about in the world, I make the case for understanding technologies of computer vision as material instances of embodied seeing and situated knowing. Furthermore, borrowing from Iris Murdoch's concept of moral vision, I suggest that these technologies direct our labor towards self-reflection in ethically significant ways. My approach draws upon paradigms in computer vision research, phenomenology, and feminist epistemology. Ultimately, this essay is an argument for directing more philosophical attention from merely criticizing technologies of vision as ethically deficient towards embracing them as complex, methodologically and epistemologically important objects.","Sat, 9 Mar 2024 05:50:32 UTC (670 KB)"

It argues that this work, considered in light of recent studies of scientific writings by Jesuit astronomers who in the seventeenth century were opposed to the ideas of Copernicus, points to interesting things yet to be learned regarding the Vatican's actions on heliocentrism. Concern for Scripture and for the fallible and consequential nature of science, together with the processes used by the Vatican in these confrontations, inevitably led to messy results in these well-known ""religion and science"" confrontations. Nevertheless, these confrontations suggest that what the Vatican was attempting to do in confronting evolution or heliocentrism is something that is needed in science, and something that will be done in the future, probably not by the Vatican, and probably in a fashion not less messy.","Fri, 8 Mar 2024 18:37:11 UTC (1,283 KB)"

Duerr","History and Philosophy of Physics (physics.hist-ph)","The paper argues that we ought to conceive of the Dark Energy problem -- the question of how to account for observational data, naturally interpreted as accelerated expansion of the universe -- as a crisis of underdetermined pursuit-worthiness. Not only are the various approaches to the Dark Energy problem evidentially underdetermined; at present, no compelling reasons single out any of them as more likely to be true than the other. More vexingly for working scientists, none of the approaches stands out as uncontroversially preferable over its rivals in terms of its rationally warranted promise, i.e. the reasons to further work on, explore and develop it. We demonstrate this claim by applying a Peircean economic model of pursuit-worthiness in terms of a cognitive cost/benefit estimate -- with the instantiation of theory virtues as key indicators of cognitive gains -- to the four main Dark Energy proposals (the cosmological constant approach, modified gravity, quintessence, and inhomogeneous cosmologies). Our analysis yields that these approaches do not admit of an unambiguous, or uncontroversial, ranking with respect to which ansatz deserves distinguished attention and research efforts. The overall methodological counsel that our analysis underwrites recommends a pragmatic double research strategy forward: to encourage and foster theory pluralism and the search for tests -- with the goal of enhancing the testability of the $\Lambda$CDM model and ""testing it to destruction"".","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 09:49:37 UTC (105 KB)"
"20","Relational Quantum Mechanics, Quantum Relativism, and the Iteration of Relativity","Timotheus Riedel","History and Philosophy of Physics (physics.hist-ph)","The idea that the dynamical properties of quantum systems are invariably relative to other systems has recently regained currency. Using Relational Quantum Mechanics (RQM) for a case study, this paper calls attention to a question that has been underappreciated in the debate about quantum relativism: the question of whether relativity iterates. Are there absolute facts about the properties one system possesses relative to a specified reference, or is this again a relative matter, and so on? It is argued that RQM (in its best-known form) is committed to what I call the Unrestricted Iteration Principle (UIP), and thus to an infinite regress of relativisations. This principle plays a crucial role in ensuring the communicability and coherence of interaction outcomes across observers. It is, however, shown to be incompatible with the widespread, conservative reading of RQM in terms of relations, instead necessitating the adoption of the more unorthodox notion of perspectival facts. I conclude with some reflections on the current state of play in perspectivist versions of RQM and quantum relativism more generally, underscoring both the need for further conceptual development and the importance of the iteration principle for an accurate cost-benefit analysis of such interpretations.","Wed, 6 Mar 2024 21:48:41 UTC (153 KB)"

Starostin","History and Philosophy of Physics (physics.hist-ph)","This article advances the hypothesis that the heightened eschatological sensitivity evident among the historians writing in the 5th century and its weaker echos in the time of Charlemagne were caused by the irregularities of the the lunisolar calendar and its particular realization, the Easter calendar. The lunisolar calendar that Christians used for the calculation of the date of the Easter had a number of key periods when the cycles of the Sun and the Moon came in sync in relationship to the beginning of the count and thus produced an effect of the times repeating themselves or ending with the nearly precise astronomical repetition. It is shown that Late Antique scholars who were actively involved in the construction of the Christian history's chronology were limited in their choices by the astronomical peculiarities of the Earth-Moon system. The total conjunctions of the astronomical Solar and Lunar calendars took place, some within the 1st century CE, and the next one, in 483 CE. This was also a special year because the lunar calendar lost one day. Thus the 5th century was the time of heightened expectations of whether the calendar and the Moon's showings will repeat those that accompanied the birth of Jesus. The Full Supermoon (or whatever phase it was on December 25th, 1 BCE) may have repeated in 410 CE (the entry of Goths into Rome), in 467 CE and in 476 CE (the Fall of the Roman Empire), marking the coming of the time very similar to Jesus' birth. The Full Moon was supposed to repeat December 25th, 800 CE and in the year 1000 CE. This may have determined the setting of the biblical calendar in a way that put the birth of Christ on 5199 CE (making the year 800 CE, the year of the Full Supermoon or of its phase on December 25th, 1 BCE) a critical turning point.","Wed, 6 Mar 2024 13:08:51 UTC (32 KB)"

A Structural Analysis of the Human Reasoning System for Elucidating LLM Capabilities and Risks Through the Lens of Heidegger's Philosophy","Jianqiiu Zhang","Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)","In the rapidly evolving field of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is a critical need to thoroughly analyze their capabilities and risks. Central to our investigation are two novel elements. Firstly, it is the innovative parallels between the statistical patterns of word relationships within LLMs and Martin Heidegger's concepts of ""ready-to-hand"" and ""present-at-hand,"" which encapsulate the utilitarian and scientific altitudes humans employ in interacting with the world. This comparison lays the groundwork for positioning LLMs as the digital counterpart to the Faculty of Verbal Knowledge, shedding light on their capacity to emulate certain facets of human reasoning. Secondly, a structural analysis of human reasoning, viewed through Heidegger's notion of truth as ""unconcealment"" is conducted This foundational principle enables us to map out the inputs and outputs of the reasoning system and divide reasoning into four distinct categories. Respective cognitive faculties are delineated, allowing us to place LLMs within the broader schema of human reasoning, thus clarifying their strengths and inherent limitations. Our findings reveal that while LLMs possess the capability for Direct Explicative Reasoning and Pseudo Rational Reasoning, they fall short in authentic rational reasoning and have no creative reasoning capabilities, due to the current lack of many analogous AI models such as the Faculty of Judgement. The potential and risks of LLMs when they are augmented with other AI technologies are also evaluated. The results indicate that although LLMs have achieved proficiency in some reasoning abilities, the aspiration to match or exceed human intellectual capabilities is yet unattained. This research not only enriches our comprehension of LLMs but also propels forward the discourse on AI's potential and its bounds, paving the way for future explorations into AI's evolving landscape.","Tue, 5 Mar 2024 19:40:53 UTC (601 KB)"

Over the last three decades, user experience (UX) practice can be divided into three stages in terms of technology platform, user needs, design philosophy, ecosystem, scope, focus, and methodology of UX practice. UX practice is moving towards the intelligence era. Still, the existing UX paradigm mainly aims at non-intelligent systems and lacks a systematic approach to address UX for designing and developing human-centered AI products and systems. The intelligence era has put forward new demands on the UX paradigm. This paper proposes a ""UX 3.0"" paradigm framework and the corresponding UX methodology for UX practice in the intelligence era. The ""UX 3.0"" paradigm framework includes four categories of emerging experiences in the intelligence era: ecosystem-based experience, innovation-enabled experience, AI-enabled experience, and human-AI interaction-based experience, each compelling us to enhance current UX practice in terms of design philosophy, scope, focus, and methodology. We believe that the ""UX 3.0"" paradigm helps enhance existing UX practice and provides methodological support for the research and applications of UX in developing human-centered AI systems.

"27","Public Projects with Preferences and Predictions","Mary Monroe, Bo Waggoner","Computer Science and Game Theory (cs.GT)","In the public projects problem, a group of decisionmakers aggregate their preferences to choose one alternative. Recent work on public projects has proposed the Quadratic Transfers Mechanism (QTM) and shown asymptotic welfare guarantees in some cases. We begin by giving new non-asymptotic Price of Anarchy guarantees for the QTM. We then incorporate an alternative philosophy toward group decisionmaking, aggregation of information about which is the best alternative. We propose a public projects mechanism based on the QTM that aggregates both preferences and predictions, modeled as forecasts of the projects' welfare impacts. When the predictions come from a prediction market or wagering mechanism, we show the entire mechanism is robust to manipulation and give Price of Anarchy guarantees, though under strong assumptions on the mechanism's knowledge. Our results focus primarily on the case of deciding between two alternatives, showing the Price of Anarchy tends to $1$ as natural measures of the ""size"" of the population grow large. In most cases, the mechanisms achieve a balanced budget as well.","Sat, 2 Mar 2024 00:26:57 UTC (32 KB)"
"28","A framework for understanding data science","Michael L Brodie","Other Statistics (stat.OT)","The objective of this research is to provide a framework with which the data science community can understand, define, and develop data science as a field of inquiry. The framework is based on the classical reference framework (axiology, ontology, epistemology, methodology) used for 200 years to define knowledge discovery paradigms and disciplines in the humanities, sciences, algorithms, and now data science. I augmented it for automated problem-solving with (methods, technology, community). The resulting data science reference framework is used to define the data science knowledge discovery paradigm in terms of the philosophy of data science addressed in previous papers and the data science problem-solving paradigm, i.e., the data science method, and the data science problem-solving workflow, both addressed in this paper. The framework is a much called for unifying framework for data science as it contains the components required to define data science. For insights to better understand data science, this paper uses the framework to define the emerging, often enigmatic, data science problem-solving paradigm and workflow, and to compare them with their well-understood scientific counterparts, scientific problem-solving paradigm and workflow.","Wed, 14 Feb 2024 15:55:40 UTC (4,403 KB)"

We ask whether $Z$ is capable of understanding, and show that different schools of thought within seminal AI research seem to answer this question differently, uncovering their terminological disagreement. Moving forward, we propose two distinct working definitions for understanding which explicitly acknowledge the question of consciousness, and draw connections with a rich literature in philosophy, psychology and neuroscience.","Fri, 1 Mar 2024 12:42:47 UTC (8,197 KB)"

(2021) defend the idea that the ambiguity of the term ""explanation"" in explainable AI (XAI) can be solved by adopting any of four different extant accounts of explanation in the philosophy of science: the Deductive Nomological, Inductive Statistical, Causal Mechanical, and New Mechanist models. In this chapter, I show that the authors' claim that these accounts can be applied to deep neural networks as they would to any natural phenomenon is mistaken. I also provide a more general argument as to why the notion of explainability as it is currently used in the XAI literature bears little resemblance to the traditional concept of scientific explanation. It would be more fruitful to use the label ""understandable AI"" to avoid the confusion that surrounds the goal and purposes of XAI. In the second half of the chapter, I argue for a pragmatic conception of understanding that is better suited to play the central role attributed to explanation in XAI. Following Kuorikoski & Ylikoski (2015), the conditions of satisfaction for understanding an ML system are fleshed out in terms of an agent's success in using the system, in drawing correct inferences from it.","Fri, 1 Mar 2024 06:28:53 UTC (435 KB)"

In this study, we extend this philosophy to a multilingual scenario, delving into multilingual human value concepts in LLMs. Through our comprehensive exploration covering 7 types of human values, 16 languages and 3 LLM series with distinct multilinguality, we empirically substantiate the existence of multilingual human values in LLMs. Further cross-lingual analysis on these concepts discloses 3 traits arising from language resource disparities: cross-lingual inconsistency, distorted linguistic relationships, and unidirectional cross-lingual transfer between high- and low-resource languages, all in terms of human value concepts. Additionally, we validate the feasibility of cross-lingual control over value alignment capabilities of LLMs, leveraging the dominant language as a source language. Drawing from our findings on multilingual value alignment, we prudently provide suggestions on the composition of multilingual data for LLMs pre-training: including a limited number of dominant languages for cross-lingual alignment transfer while avoiding their excessive prevalence, and keeping a balanced distribution of non-dominant languages. We aspire that our findings would contribute to enhancing the safety and utility of multilingual AI.","Wed, 28 Feb 2024 07:18:39 UTC (3,075 KB)"

Learners discover and acquire knowledge through first-hand tangible experiences, building their own representations in a constructivist learning process. Usual pedagogical goals of the activities include introduction to the principles of control, mechanics, programming, and robotics [1]. They are organized as hands-on learning situations with teamwork cooperation of learners, project-based learning, sharing and presentations of the learners group experiences. Arriving from this tradition, we focus on a slightly different scenarios: employing the robotics sets and the named approaches when learning Physics, Mathematics, Art, Science, and other subjects. In carefully designed projects, learners build interactive models that demonstrate concepts, principles, and phenomena, perform experiments, and modify them in elaboration phases with the aim to connect, create associations and links to the actual underlying theoretical curriculum. In this way, they are collecting practical experiences which are prerequisite to successful learning process. Based on feedback from children, we continue upon two previous sets of activities that focused on Physics and Mathematics, this time with projects built around games. Learners play various games with physical artifacts in the real-world - with the models they build. They acquire skills while playing the games, analyze them, and learn about the underlying principles. They modify the game rules, strategies, create extensions, and interact with each other in an entertaining and engaging settings.

There is no generally accepted derivation of Born's rule from first principles. In this paper, it is motivated from assumptions that link the ontological content of a proper physical model to the epistemic conditions of the experimental context. More precisely, it is assumed that all knowable distinctions should correspond to distinctions in a proper model. This principle of ""ontological completeness"" means, for example, that the probabilistic treatment of the double slit experiment with and without path information should differ. Further, it is assumed that the model should rely only on knowable ontological elements, and that failure to fulfill this principle of ""ontological minimalism"" gives rise to wrong predictions. Consequently, probabilities should be assigned only to observable experimental outcomes. Also, the method to calculate such probabilities should not rely on the existence of a precise path of the observed object if this path is not knowable. A similar principle was promoted by Born, even though he did not apply it to probability. Another crucial assumption is that the proper rule to calculate probabilities should be generally valid. It should be applicable in all experimental contexts, regardless the setup that determines which attributes of the studied object are observed, together with the probability to observe each of the associated attribute values. There is no need to refer to the Hilbert space structure of quantum mechanics in the present treatment. Rather, some elements of this structure emerge from the analysis.","Mon, 26 Feb 2024 23:03:37 UTC (112 KB)"
"38","New Prospects for a Causally Local Formulation of Quantum Theory","Jacob A. Barandes","Quantum Physics (quant-ph)","It is difficult to extract reliable criteria for causal locality from the limited ingredients found in textbook quantum theory. In the end, Bell humbly warned that his eponymous theorem was based on criteria that ""should be viewed with the utmost suspicion."" Remarkably, by stepping outside the wave-function paradigm, one can reformulate quantum theory in terms of old-fashioned configuration spaces together with 'unistochastic' laws. These unistochastic laws take the form of directed conditional probabilities, which turn out to provide a hospitable foundation for encoding microphysical causal relationships. This unistochastic reformulation provides quantum theory with a simpler and more transparent axiomatic foundation, plausibly resolves the measurement problem, and deflates various exotic claims about superposition, interference, and entanglement. Making use of this reformulation, this paper introduces a new principle of causal locality that is intended to improve on Bell's criteria, and shows directly that systems that remain at spacelike separation cannot exert causal influences on each other, according to that new principle. These results therefore lead to a general hidden-variables interpretation of quantum theory that is arguably compatible with causal locality.","Mon, 26 Feb 2024 18:19:51 UTC (73 KB)"

It is often called ""von Neumann's projection postulate"" or ""the Lüders rule"". This paper is an examination of the versions of this postulate due to Dirac, von Neumann and Lüders. It is shown that Dirac, in 1930, proposed what is now generally known as the projection postulate. Von Neumann, in 1932, gave a different theory which only applies in special and rather unusual cases. Lüders, in 1951, rejected this theory and presented one which is the same as Dirac's. Treatments of observables with continuous spectra by both Dirac and von Neumann are criticised, and the possibility of a generalised version of the projection postulate for this case is considered. The paper concludes with a discussion of the status of the projection postulate (in its various forms) as a separate postulate (independent of the other postulates of quantum mechanics) and as a separate form of time development (in addition to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation).","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 12:06:39 UTC (12 KB)[v2] Tue, 5 Mar 2024 20:33:00 UTC (12 KB)"

AFDM is based on the discrete affine Fourier transform (DAFT) with two modifiable parameters of the chirp signals, termed as the pre-chirp parameter and post-chirp parameter, respectively. These parameters can be fine-tuned to avoid overlapping channel paths with different delays or Doppler shifts, leading to performance enhancement especially for doubly dispersive channel. In this paper, we propose a novel AFDM structure with the pre-chirp index modulation (PIM) philosophy (AFDM-PIM), which can embed additional information bits into the pre-chirp parameter design for both spectral and energy efficiency enhancement. Specifically, we first demonstrate that the application of distinct pre-chirp parameters to various subcarriers in the AFDM modulation process maintains the orthogonality among these subcarriers. Then, different pre-chirp parameters are flexibly assigned to each AFDM subcarrier according to the incoming bits. By such arrangement, aside from classical phase/amplitude modulation, extra binary bits can be implicitly conveyed by the indices of selected pre-chirping parameters realizations without additional energy consumption. At the receiver, both a maximum likelihood (ML) detector and a reduced-complexity ML-minimum mean square error (ML-MMSE) detector are employed to recover the information bits. It has been shown via simulations that the proposed AFDM-PIM exhibits superior bit error rate (BER) performance compared to classical AFDM, OFDM and IM-aided OFDM algorithms.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 08:32:50 UTC (384 KB)"

A. Muller's classical treatment of the subject; (iv) A proof that the equivalence of Matrix and Wave Mechanics is necessitated by the formal requirements of a dual action functional from which both the dynamical postulates of orthodox quantum mechanics, von Neumann's process 1 and process 2, follow; (v) A critical assessment, based on (iii) and (iv), of von Neumann's construction of unified quantum mechanics over Hilbert space. Point (iv) is our main result. It brings to the open the important, but hitherto ignored, fact that orthodox quantum mechanics is no exception to the golden rule of physics that the dynamics of a physical theory must follow from the action functional. If orthodox quantum mechanics, based as it is on the assumption of the equivalence of Matrix and Wave Mechanics, has this ""peculiar dual dynamics,"" as von Neumann called it, this is so because by assuming the equivalence one has been assuming a peculiar dual action.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 00:10:53 UTC (48 KB)"

While irreversible thermodynamics led by Onsager focuses on internal variables though often mixed with external variables. Hillert integrated them together by first emphasizing their differences and then examining their connections. His philosophy was reflected by the title of his book ""Phase Equilibria, Phase Diagrams and Phase Transformations"" that puts equilibrium, nonequilibrium, and internal processes on equal footing. In the present paper honoring Hillert, the present author reflects his experiences with Hillert in last 35 years and expresses his gratitude for all the wisdom and support from him in terms of ""Hillert nonequilibrium thermodynamics"" and discusses some recent topics that the present author has been working on.","Thu, 22 Feb 2024 02:23:13 UTC (2,296 KB)"

However, they cannot be directly applied to questions without a fixed resolution criterion, and real-world applications of prediction markets to such questions often amount to predicting not whether a sentence is true, but whether it will be proven. Such questions could be represented by countable unions or intersections of more basic events, or as First-Order-Logic sentences on the Arithmetical Hierarchy (or even beyond FOL, as hyperarithmetical sentences). In this paper, we propose an approach to betting on such events via options, or equivalently as bets on the outcome of a ""verification-falsification game"". Our work thus acts as an alternative to the existing framework of Garrabrant induction for logical uncertainty, and relates to the stance known as constructivism in the philosophy of mathematics; furthermore it has broader implications for philosophy and mathematical logic.","Mon, 29 Jan 2024 17:30:34 UTC (32 KB)"

Hand in hand with physics, we venture into the realm of neuroscience to explain the existence of quasi-universal scaling properties across brain regions, setting out to quantify the distance of their dynamics from a critical point. Next, we move into the grounds of artificial intelligence, where the very same theory of critical phenomena will prove very useful for explaining the effects of biologically-inspired plasticity rules in the forecasting ability of Reservoir Computers. Halfway into our journey, we explore the concept of neural representations of external stimuli, unveiling a surprising link between the dynamical regime of neural networks and the optimal topological properties of such representation manifolds.

This paper provides new conceptual foundations for gravitational thermodynamics by reconsidering the nature of key concepts like equilibrium and advancing a novel way of understanding thermodynamics. The challenges arise from the peculiar characteristics of the gravitational potential, leading to non-extensive energy and entropy, negative heat capacity, and a lack of standard equilibrium. Hence it has been claimed that only non-equilibrium statistical mechanics is warranted in this domain, whereas thermodynamics is inapplicable. We argue instead that equilibrium statistical mechanics applies to self-gravitating systems at the relevant scale, as they display equilibrium in the form of metastable quasi-equilibrium states. We then develop a minimal framework for thermodynamics that can be applied to these systems and beyond. Thermodynamics applies in the sense that we can devise macroscopic descriptions and explanations of the behaviour of these systems in terms of coarse-grained quantities within equilibrium statistical mechanics.","Sun, 18 Feb 2024 17:40:11 UTC (207 KB)"

One of the most discussed, classification parity, requires that the erroneous classifications of a predictive algorithm occur with equal frequency for groups picked out by protected characteristics. Despite its intuitive appeal, classification parity has come under attack. Multiple scenarios can be imagined in which - intuitively - a predictive algorithm does not treat any individual unfairly, and yet classification parity is violated. To make progress, we turn to a related principle, equal protection, originally developed in the context of criminal justice. Key to equal protection is equalizing the risks of erroneous classifications (in a sense to be specified) as opposed to equalizing the rates of erroneous classifications. We show that equal protection avoids many of the counterexamples to classification parity, but also fails to model our moral intuitions in a number of common scenarios, for example, when the predictor is causally downstream relative to the protected characteristic. To address these difficulties, we defend a novel principle, causal equal protection, that models the fair allocation of the risks of erroneous classification through the lenses of causality.","Mon, 19 Feb 2024 11:30:00 UTC (231 KB)[v2] Tue, 20 Feb 2024 22:53:23 UTC (231 KB)"

To this end, we propose a Learning to Edit (LTE) framework, focusing on teaching LLMs to apply updated knowledge into input questions, inspired by the philosophy of ""Teach a man to fish."" LTE features a two-phase process: (i) the Alignment Phase, which fine-tunes LLMs on a meticulously curated parallel dataset to make reliable, in-scope edits while preserving out-of-scope information and linguistic proficiency; and (ii) the Inference Phase, which employs a retrieval-based mechanism for real-time and mass knowledge editing. By comparing our approach with seven advanced baselines across four popular knowledge editing benchmarks and two LLM architectures, we demonstrate LTE's superiority in knowledge editing performance, robustness in both batch and sequential editing, minimal interference on general tasks, and rapid editing speeds.

I start the paper with the observation that we have recently witnessed a generative turn in AI, since generative models, including LLMs, are key for self-supervised learning. To assess the question of semantic grounding, I distinguish and discuss five methodological ways. The most promising way is to apply core assumptions of theories of meaning in philosophy of mind and language to LLMs. Grounding proves to be a gradual affair with a three-dimensional distinction between functional, social and causal grounding. LLMs show basic evidence in all three dimensions. A strong argument is that LLMs develop world models. Hence, LLMs are neither stochastic parrots nor semantic zombies, but already understand the language they generate, at least in an elementary sense.","Fri, 16 Feb 2024 14:23:55 UTC (151 KB)"

Like a classical reference frame, a QRF can be used to define physical quantities such as time, position, momentum, and spin relationally. Unlike its classical analogue, it relativises the notions of superposition and entanglement. Here, we provide a novel explanation for the frame-dependence of superposition and entanglement by tracing it back to the question of how configurations or locations are identified across different branches in superposition. We show that, in the presence of symmetries, whether a system is in 'the same' or 'different' configurations across the branches depends on the choice of QRF. Thus, sameness and difference-and, as a result, superposition and entanglement-lose their absolute meaning. We apply these ideas to semi-classical spacetimes in superposition and use coincidences of four scalar fields to construct a comparison map between the spacetime points in the different branches. This allows us to determine whether a given event is located at 'the same' or 'different' points in the superposed spacetimes. Since this feature depends on the choice of QRF, we argue that the localisation of an event should not be seen as an inherent property. This alleviates previously voiced concerns that QRF changes could have empirical consequences for interference experiments, such as the BMV proposal. Moreover, it implies that the number of events is equal in both the flat and the curved spacetime implementations of indefinite causal order. We conclude with the 'quantum hole argument' as a generalisation of Einstein's hole argument, arguing that not just spacetime points but also their identification across a superposition lose their absolute physical meaning.","Thu, 15 Feb 2024 19:00:01 UTC (1,015 KB)"
"54","Text-Based Product Matching -- Semi-Supervised Clustering Approach","Alicja Martinek, Szymon Łukasik, Amir H. Gandomi","Databases (cs.DB)","Matching identical products present in multiple product feeds constitutes a crucial element of many tasks of e-commerce, such as comparing product offerings, dynamic price optimization, and selecting the assortment personalized for the client. It corresponds to the well-known machine learning task of entity matching, with its own specificity, like omnipresent unstructured data or inaccurate and inconsistent product descriptions. This paper aims to present a new philosophy to product matching utilizing a semi-supervised clustering approach. We study the properties of this method by experimenting with the IDEC algorithm on the real-world dataset using predominantly textual features and fuzzy string matching, with more standard approaches as a point of reference. Encouraging results show that unsupervised matching, enriched with a small annotated sample of product links, could be a possible alternative to the dominant supervised strategy, requiring extensive manual data labeling.","Thu, 1 Feb 2024 18:52:26 UTC (1,664 KB)"

Sophistication is the most popular attitude towards some of these questions: roughly, it takes models related by these symmetries to represent the same physical possibility. In the previous paper in this series, I discussed obstacles to sophistication and then showed how these obstacles are overcome by theories that fulfill three Desiderata (i-iii). But this resolution still leaves open two main worries about sophistication: (a) it allows the individuation of structure-tokens to remain intractably prolix and thus of limited use, which is why practising physicists frequently invoke 'relational, symmetry-invariant observables'; and (b) it leaves us with no formal framework for expressing counterfactual statements about the world. Here I will show that a third Desideratum, (iii), answers these worries. The new Desideratum requires a `relational' understanding \emph{of coordinates} (or frames, etc).","Wed, 14 Feb 2024 14:28:22 UTC (94 KB)"

"60","Thinking twice inside the box: is Wigner's friend really quantum?","Caroline L. Jones, Markus P. Mueller","Quantum Physics (quant-ph)","There has been a surge of recent interest in the Wigner's friend paradox, sparking several novel thought experiments and no-go theorems. The main narrative has been that Wigner's friend highlights a counterintuitive feature that is unique to quantum theory, and which is closely related to the quantum measurement problem. Here, we challenge this view. We argue that the gist of the Wigner's friend paradox can be reproduced without assuming quantum physics, and that it underlies a much broader class of enigmas in the foundations of physics and philosophy. To show this, we first consider several recently proposed extended Wigner's friend scenarios, and demonstrate that their implications for the absoluteness of observations can be reproduced by classical thought experiments that involve the duplication of agents. Crucially, some of these classical scenarios are technologically much easier to implement than their quantum counterparts. Then, we argue that the essential structural ingredient of all these scenarios is a feature that we call ""Restriction A"": essentially, that a physical theory cannot give us a probabilistic description of the observations of all agents. Finally, we argue that this difficulty is at the core of other puzzles in the foundations of physics and philosophy, and demonstrate this explicitly for cosmology's Boltzmann brain problem. Our analysis suggests that Wigner's friend should be studied in a larger context, addressing a frontier of human knowledge that exceeds the boundaries of quantum physics: to obtain reliable predictions for experiments in which these predictions can be privately but not intersubjectively verified.","Tue, 13 Feb 2024 19:00:13 UTC (393 KB)"

It is important because it underlies many other concepts we care about, such as agency, manipulation, legal responsibility, and blame. However, ascribing intent to AI systems is contentious, and there is no universally accepted theory of intention applicable to AI agents. We operationalise the intention with which an agent acts, relating to the reasons it chooses its decision. We introduce a formal definition of intention in structural causal influence models, grounded in the philosophy literature on intent and applicable to real-world machine learning systems. Through a number of examples and results, we show that our definition captures the intuitive notion of intent and satisfies desiderata set-out by past work. In addition, we show how our definition relates to past concepts, including actual causality, and the notion of instrumental goals, which is a core idea in the literature on safe AI agents. Finally, we demonstrate how our definition can be used to infer the intentions of reinforcement learning agents and language models from their behaviour.","Sun, 11 Feb 2024 14:39:40 UTC (190 KB)[v2] Thu, 15 Feb 2024 11:45:37 UTC (186 KB)"

To do so, we prove a fact of independent interest, that half of the nilBrauer algebra is Koszul. This BGG resolution categorifies a character formula of Brundan-Wang-Webster. More generally, we have a (functorial) ``BGG spectral sequence'' which converges to any desired module; this spectral sequence is secretly a resolution when the desired module is finite-dimensional. This spectral sequence also categorifies the character formulae of Brundan-Wang-Webster for any (possibly infinite-dimensional) simple module.

A highly idealized model of a locally interacting system and environment is described, and investigated in several situations in which branching occurs, including those involving Bell inequality violating correlations; we illustrate how any non-locality is compatible with the locality of the dynamics. Although branching is particularly important for many worlds quantum theory, we take a neutral stance here, simply tracing out the consequences of a unitary dynamics. The overall goals are to provide a simple concrete realization of the quantum physics of branch formation, and especially to emphasise the compatibility of branching with relativity; the paper is intended to illuminate matters both for foundational work, and for the application of quantum theory to non-isolated systems.","Sat, 10 Feb 2024 00:34:57 UTC (23 KB)"

While numerous results support this conjecture, S. J. Miller observed that for finite conductors, very different behavior can occur for zeros near the central point in elliptic curve families. This led to the excised model of Dueñez, Huynh, Keating, Miller, and Snaith, whose predictions for quadratic twists of a given elliptic curve are beautifully fit by the data. The key ingredients are relating the discretization of central values of the $L$-functions to excising matrices based on the value of the characteristic polynomials at 1 and using lower order terms (in statistics such as the one-level density and pair-correlation) to adjust the matrix size. We discuss recent successes by the authors in extending this model to a family of quadratic twists of finite conductor of a given holomorphic cuspidal newform of level an odd prime level.

We will use non-relativistic quantum mechanics as a case study. We begin by distinguishing two roles for ontology: the first would be characterized by cataloging existing entities according to quantum mechanics; the second would be characterized by establishing more general ontological categories in which existing entities must be classified. We argue that only the first step is available for a naturalistic approach; the second step not being open for determination or anchoring in science. Finally, we also argue that metaphysics is still a step beyond ontology, not contained in either of the two tasks of ontology, being thus even farther from science.","Thu, 8 Feb 2024 13:26:13 UTC (67 KB)"

With the rapid development of the domestic power market and the continuous innovation of technology, the domestic multi-functional electricity meters have experienced the transformation from simple billing to complex multi-functional, from a single application to a wide range of fields. This transformation has not only driven the rapid development of electricity meter technology, but also met the increasing power demand and management requirements. This paper expounds the concept of multi-function meter, the working principle and algorithm of digital multiplier, the initiation and evolution of multi-function electricity meter standard, and the initiation and evolution of domestic multi-function electricity meter products. Although the domestic independent production of multi-functional meter has made great achievements in performance, but in the reliability and key process technology still need to be improved.

The primary bottlenecks include 1) Intensive training resource requirements, 2) Hyper-parameter sensitivity leading to inconsistent outputs, and 3) Balancing the intricacies of novel visual concept and composition alignment. We start by re-iterating the core philosophy of T2I diffusion models to address the above limitations. Predominantly, contemporary subject-driven T2I approaches hinge on Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), which facilitate T2I mapping through cross-attention layers. While LDMs offer distinct advantages, P-T2I methods' reliance on the latent space of these diffusion models significantly escalates resource demands, leading to inconsistent results and necessitating numerous iterations for a single desired image. Recently, ECLIPSE has demonstrated a more resource-efficient pathway for training UnCLIP-based T2I models, circumventing the need for diffusion text-to-image priors. Building on this, we introduce $\lambda$-ECLIPSE. Our method illustrates that effective P-T2I does not necessarily depend on the latent space of diffusion models. $\lambda$-ECLIPSE achieves single, multi-subject, and edge-guided T2I personalization with just 34M parameters and is trained on a mere 74 GPU hours using 1.6M image-text interleaved data. Through extensive experiments, we also establish that $\lambda$-ECLIPSE surpasses existing baselines in composition alignment while preserving concept alignment performance, even with significantly lower resource utilization.","Wed, 7 Feb 2024 19:07:10 UTC (25,530 KB)"

Despite this democratization of learning, the massive enrollment in these courses means it is almost impossible for one instructor to assess every student's writing assignment. As a result, peer grading, often guided by a straightforward rubric, is the method of choice. While convenient, peer grading often falls short in terms of reliability and validity. In this study, using 18 distinct settings, we explore the feasibility of leveraging large language models (LLMs) to replace peer grading in MOOCs. Specifically, we focus on two state-of-the-art LLMs: GPT-4 and GPT-3.5, across three distinct courses: Introductory Astronomy, Astrobiology, and the History and Philosophy of Astronomy. To instruct LLMs, we use three different prompts based on a variant of the zero-shot chain-of-thought (Zero-shot-CoT) prompting technique: Zero-shot-CoT combined with instructor-provided correct answers; Zero-shot-CoT in conjunction with both instructor-formulated answers and rubrics; and Zero-shot-CoT with instructor-offered correct answers and LLM-generated rubrics. Our results show that Zero-shot-CoT, when integrated with instructor-provided answers and rubrics, produces grades that are more aligned with those assigned by instructors compared to peer grading. However, the History and Philosophy of Astronomy course proves to be more challenging in terms of grading as opposed to other courses. Finally, our study reveals a promising direction for automating grading systems for MOOCs, especially in subjects with well-defined rubrics.","Tue, 6 Feb 2024 07:43:07 UTC (39 KB)[v2] Sat, 10 Feb 2024 22:43:41 UTC (41 KB)[v3] Thu, 22 Feb 2024 00:43:19 UTC (49 KB)[v4] Fri, 1 Mar 2024 04:48:41 UTC (49 KB)"

It also shows the way the physical and mathematical sciences operate, allowing us to accurately describe the observed regularities in terms of communicable mathematical laws. The latter say nothing about the intrinsic features of things. They only refer to the observed regularities in their behaviors, providing rigorous descriptions of how the universe works, to which any viable ontology must conform. Classical mechanistic determinism limits everything that can occur to what happens in an instant and leaves no room for novelty or any intrinsic aspect that is not epiphenomenal. The situation changes with quantum probabilistic determinism if one takes seriously the ontology that arises from its axioms of objects, systems in certain states, and the events they produce in other objects. As Bertrand Russell pointed out almost a century ago, an ontology of events, with an internal phenomenal aspect, now known as panprotopsychism, is better suited to explaining the phenomenal aspects of consciousness. The central observation of this paper is that many objections to panpsychism and panprotopsychism, which are usually called the combination problem, arise from implicit hypotheses based on classical physics about supervenience. These are inappropriate at the quantum level, where an exponential number of emergent properties and states arise. The analysis imposes conditions on the possible implementations of quantum cognition mechanisms in the brain.","Sun, 4 Feb 2024 19:17:28 UTC (34 KB)"

A second limitation is the conflation of different dimensions under the same banner, in particular confusion between ethics curricula geared towards addressing the ethics of individual conduct and curricula geared towards addressing ethics at the societal level. In this article, we propose a tripartite framework to overcome these difficulties. Our framework analytically decomposes an ethics module into three dimensions. First, there is the ethical dimension, which pertains to the learning goals. Second, there is the moral dimension, which addresses the moral relevance of engineers conduct. Finally, there is the political dimension, which scales up issues of moral relevance at the civic level. All in all, our framework has two advantages. First, it provides analytic clarity, i.e. it enables course instructors to locate ethical dilemmas in either the moral or political realm and to make use of the tools and resources from moral and political philosophy. Second, it depicts a comprehensive ethical training, which enables students to both reason about moral issues in the abstract, and to socially contextualize potential solutions.","Mon, 5 Feb 2024 09:37:52 UTC (429 KB)"

However, current design philosophy of DL-based algorithms entails intensive engineering overhead due to the manual design of deep neural networks (DNNs) for different networking tasks. Besides, DNNs tend to achieve poor generalization performance on unseen data distributions/environments. Motivated by the recent success of large language models (LLMs), for the first time, this work studies the LLM adaptation for networking to explore a more sustainable design philosophy. With the massive pre-trained knowledge and powerful inference ability, LLM can serve as the foundation model, and is expected to achieve ""one model for all"" with even better performance and stronger generalization for various tasks. In this paper, we present NetLLM, the first LLM adaptation framework that efficiently adapts LLMs to solve networking problems. NetLLM addresses many practical challenges in LLM adaptation, from how to process task-specific information with LLMs, to how to improve the efficiency of answer generation and acquiring domain knowledge for networking. Across three networking-related use cases - viewport prediction (VP), adaptive bitrate streaming (ABR) and cluster job scheduling (CJS), we showcase the effectiveness of NetLLM in LLM adaptation for networking. Results show that the adapted LLM surpasses state-of-the-art algorithms by 10.1-36.6% for VP, 14.5-36.6% for ABR, 6.8-41.3% for CJS, and also achieves superior generalization performance.","Sun, 4 Feb 2024 04:21:34 UTC (1,148 KB)"

"80","YOLinO++: Single-Shot Estimation of Generic Polylines for Mapless Automated Diving","Annika Meyer, Christoph Stiller","Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)","In automated driving, highly accurate maps are commonly used to support and complement perception. These maps are costly to create and quickly become outdated as the traffic world is permanently changing. In order to support or replace the map of an automated system with detections from sensor data, a perception module must be able to detect the map features. We propose a neural network that follows the one shot philosophy of YOLO but is designed for detection of 1D structures in images, such as lane boundaries. We extend previous ideas by a midpoint based line representation and anchor definitions. This representation can be used to describe lane borders, markings, but also implicit features such as centerlines of lanes. The broad applicability of the approach is shown with the detection performance on lane centerlines, lane borders as well as the markings both on highways and in urban areas. Versatile lane boundaries are detected and can be inherently classified as dashed or solid lines, curb, road boundaries, or implicit delimitation.","Thu, 1 Feb 2024 20:10:01 UTC (17,775 KB)"

We explain that they are due to space time symmetries. This paper is a critical review of metaphysical conclusions found in many recent articles. It advocates the importance of contextuality, Einstein causality and global symmetries. Bell tests allow only rejecting probabilistic coupling provided by a local hidden variable model, but they do not justify metaphysical speculations about quantum nonlocality and objects which know about each other state, even when separated by large distances. The violation of Bell inequalities in physics and in cognitive science can be explained using the notion of Bohr contextuality. If contextual variables, describing varying experimental contexts, are correctly incorporated into a probabilistic model, then the Bell and CHSH inequalities cannot be proven and nonlocal correlations may be explained in an intuitive way. We also elucidate the meaning of statistical independence assumption incorrectly called free choice, measurement independence or no conspiracy. Since correlation does not imply causation, the violation of statistical independence should be called contextuality and it does not restrict the experimenter freedom of choice. Therefore, contrary to what is believed, closing the freedom of choice loophole does not close the contextuality loophole.","Thu, 1 Feb 2024 16:16:10 UTC (795 KB)[v2] Tue, 27 Feb 2024 23:00:20 UTC (899 KB)"

In this paper, we introduce AwareBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate awareness in LLMs. Drawing from theories in psychology and philosophy, we define awareness in LLMs as the ability to understand themselves as AI models and to exhibit social intelligence. Subsequently, we categorize awareness in LLMs into five dimensions, including capability, mission, emotion, culture, and perspective. Based on this taxonomy, we create a dataset called AwareEval, which contains binary, multiple-choice, and open-ended questions to assess LLMs' understandings of specific awareness dimensions. Our experiments, conducted on 13 LLMs, reveal that the majority of them struggle to fully recognize their capabilities and missions while demonstrating decent social intelligence. We conclude by connecting awareness of LLMs with AI alignment and safety, emphasizing its significance to the trustworthy and ethical development of LLMs. Our dataset and code are available at this https URL.","Wed, 31 Jan 2024 14:41:23 UTC (224 KB)[v2] Fri, 16 Feb 2024 09:47:38 UTC (1,042 KB)"
"86","Tracing quantum correlations back to collective interferences","Ming Ji, Jonte R. Hance, Holger F. Hofmann","Quantum Physics (quant-ph)","In this paper, we investigate the possibility of explaining nonclassical correlations between two quantum systems in terms of quantum interferences between collective states of the two systems. We achieve this by mapping the relations between different measurement contexts in the product Hilbert space of a pair of two-level systems onto an analogous sequence of interferences between paths in a single-particle interferometer. The paradoxical relations between different measurement outcomes can then be traced to the distribution of probability currents in the interferometer. We show that the relation between probability currents and correlations can be represented by continuous conditional (quasi)probability currents through the interferometer, given by weak values; the violation of the noncontextual assumption is expressed by negative conditional currents in some of the paths. Since negative conditional currents correspond to the assignment of negative conditional probabilities to measurements results in different measurement contexts, the necessity of such negative probability currents represents a failure of noncontextual local realism. Our results help to explain the meaning of nonlocal correlations in quantum mechanics, and support Feynman's claim that interference is the origin of all quantum phenomena.","Tue, 30 Jan 2024 06:15:53 UTC (170 KB)"

"90","Pannekoek's Galaxy","Pieter C. van der Kruit","History and Philosophy of Physics (physics.hist-ph)","Antonie (Anton) Pannekoek (1873-1960) is remembered as one of the initiators of the field of stellar atmospheres. A second part of his research concerned Galactic astronomy. He was convinced that the sidereal system was built up of clouds of stars in a smooth, low-density stratum. In addition there were dark clouds together with streaks with little or no extinction in between. Pannekoek looked at bright star clouds and estimated their distance from their contribution to star counts. He found values of tens of kpc, which would mean their distribution was similar in extent to that of Shapleys globular cluster system. Later he had to reduce his distance by a factor over two, and later still retract the method. He developed a rigorous method of estimating distances of dark clouds from modeling star counts off and on the cloud, preceding Wolf's quick and dirty method. He should have received more credit for this. He started isophotal maps of the northern and southern Milky Way, first from visual observations, later from photographic surface photometry using out-of-focus exposures. I compare Pannekoeks maps with detailed photographic surface photometry of the south by the group in Bochum and to the almost all-sky mapping by the Pioneer 10 spacecraft, free of zodiacal light, from beyond the asteroid belt. This shows Panneloeks maps to be surprisingly accurate. The legacy of Pannekoek in the area of Galactic research consists of his mapping of the structure of the nearby part of the Galaxy, the distances of dark clouds, and isophotal maps of the Milky Way. His other contributions turned out inconclusive or wrong as a result of his conviction, resulting from his many years of observing and mapping the Milky Way, that the nearby distribution is characterized primarily by more or less isolated clouds of stars and by dust restricted to isolated dark clouds and streaks.","Sat, 27 Jan 2024 22:35:29 UTC (654 KB)"

I take reduction in philosophers' sense; and I argue that the prospects are good for there being a reduction of the type envisaged by Nagel. (I also discuss the prospects for the stronger functionalist variant of Nagelian reduction, that was formulated by Lewis.) One main theme will be causal set theory's use of a physical scale (viz. the Planck scale) to formulate how it recovers a Lorentzian manifold. This use illustrates various philosophical topics relevant to reduction, such as limiting relations between theories, and the role of analogy. I also emphasise causal set theory's probabilistic method, viz. Poisson sprinkling: which is used both for formulating the reduction and for exploring its prospects.","Sat, 27 Jan 2024 18:12:23 UTC (45 KB)"
"92","Distributionally Robust Optimization and Robust Statistics","Jose Blanchet, Jiajin Li, Sirui Lin, Xuhui Zhang","Methodology (stat.ME)","We review distributionally robust optimization (DRO), a principled approach for constructing statistical estimators that hedge against the impact of deviations in the expected loss between the training and deployment environments. Many well-known estimators in statistics and machine learning (e.g. AdaBoost, LASSO, ridge regression, dropout training, etc.) are distributionally robust in a precise sense. We hope that by discussing the DRO interpretation of well-known estimators, statisticians who may not be too familiar with DRO may find a way to access the DRO literature through the bridge between classical results and their DRO equivalent formulation. On the other hand, the topic of robustness in statistics has a rich tradition associated with removing the impact of contamination. Thus, another objective of this paper is to clarify the difference between DRO and classical statistical robustness. As we will see, these are two fundamentally different philosophies leading to completely different types of estimators. In DRO, the statistician hedges against an environment shift that occurs after the decision is made; thus DRO estimators tend to be pessimistic in an adversarial setting, leading to a min-max type formulation. In classical robust statistics, the statistician seeks to correct contamination that occurred before a decision is made; thus robust statistical estimators tend to be optimistic leading to a min-min type formulation.","Fri, 26 Jan 2024 05:28:17 UTC (701 KB)"

We observe that only a very few modern components are critical for learning good representations, while many others are nonessential. Our study ultimately arrives at an approach that is highly simplified and to a large extent resembles a classical DAE. We hope our study will rekindle interest in a family of classical methods within the realm of modern self-supervised learning.","Thu, 25 Jan 2024 18:59:57 UTC (8,316 KB)"

Each representation is at all effects a physical subset of the Universe, a metastructure of events in space and time, which actively participate to the evolution of the Universe as we are internal observers. The evolution is a deterministic sequence of local events, quantum measurements, originated from the local wavefunction collapse of the complementary set of the observers that generate the local events in the Universe. With these assumptions, the Universe and its evolution are described in terms of a semantically closed structure without a global object-environment loss of decoherence as a von Neumann's universal constructor with a semantical abstract whose structure cannot be decided deterministically a-priori from an internal observer. In a semantically closed structure the realization of a specific event writing the semantical abstract of the constructor is a problem that finds a ""which way"" for the evolution of the Universe in terms of a choice of the constructor's state in a metastructure, the many-world Everett scenario from the specific result of a quantum measurement, a classical Gödel undecidable proposition for an internal observer, exposing the limits of our description and possible simulation of the Universe.","Wed, 24 Jan 2024 10:01:14 UTC (43 KB)"

Zuiderveen Borgesius","Computers and Society (cs.CY)","Insurers increasingly use AI. We distinguish two situations in which insurers use AI: (i) data-intensive underwriting, and (ii) behaviour-based insurance. (i) First, insurers can use AI for data analysis to assess risks: data-intensive underwriting. Underwriting is, in short, calculating risks and amending the insurance premium accordingly. (ii) Second, insurers can use AI to monitor the behaviour of consumers in real-time: behaviour-based insurance. For example, some car insurers give a discount if a consumer agrees to being tracked by the insurer and drives safely. While the two trends bring many advantages, they may also have discriminatory effects. This paper focuses on the following question. Which discrimination-related effects may occur if insurers use data-intensive underwriting and behaviour-based insurance? We focus on two types of discrimination-related effects: discrimination and other unfair differentiation. (i) Discrimination harms certain groups who are protected by non-discrimination law, for instance people with certain ethnicities. (ii) Unfair differentiation does not harm groups that are protected by non-discrimination law, but it does seem unfair. We introduce four factors to consider when assessing the fairness of insurance practices.

They are stronger versions of four widely-studied standard opacity notions, respectively. We firstly propose a new notion of K-SSO, and then we construct a concurrent-composition structure that is a variant of our previously-proposed one to verify it. Based on this structure, a verification algorithm for the proposed notion of K-SSO is designed. Also, an upper bound on K in the proposed K-SSO is derived. Secondly, we propose a distinctive opacity-enforcement mechanism that has better scalability than the existing ones (such as supervisory control). The basic philosophy of this new mechanism is choosing a subset of controllable transitions to disable before an original system starts to run in order to cut off all its runs that violate a notion of strong SBO of interest. Accordingly, the algorithms for enforcing the above-mentioned four notions of strong SBO are designed using the proposed two concurrent-composition structures. In particular, the designed algorithm for enforcing Inf-SSO has lower time complexity than the existing one in the literature, and does not depend on any assumption. Finally, we illustrate the applications of the designed algorithms using examples.","Thu, 18 Jan 2024 20:13:02 UTC (29 KB)"

Computationally, real numbers can be represented in several ways; most commonly using inexact floating-point data-types, but also using exact arbitrary-precision data-types which satisfy the expected mathematical properties of the reals. This thesis is concerned with formalising properties of certain types for exact real arithmetic, as well as utilising them computationally for the purposes of search, optimisation and regression. We develop, in a constructive and univalent type-theoretic foundation of mathematics, a formalised framework for performing search, optimisation and regression on a wide class of types. This framework utilises Martín Escardó's prior work on searchable types, along with a convenient version of ultrametric spaces -- which we call closeness spaces -- in order to consistently search certain infinite types using the functional programming language and proof assistant Agda. We formally define and prove the convergence properties of type-theoretic variants of global optimisation and parametric regression, problems related to search from the literature of analysis. As we work in a constructive setting, these convergence theorems yield computational algorithms for correct optimisation and regression on the types of our framework. Importantly, we can instantiate our framework on data-types from the literature of exact real arithmetic, allowing us to perform our variants of search, optimisation and regression on ternary signed-digit encodings of the real numbers, as well as a simplified version of Hans-J. Boehm's functional encodings of real numbers. Furthermore, we contribute to the extensive work on ternary signed-digits by formally verifying the definition of certain exact real arithmetic operations using the Escardó-Simpson interval object specification of compact intervals.","Wed, 17 Jan 2024 15:18:28 UTC (174 KB)"

"108","Reliability and Interpretability in Science and Deep Learning","Luigi Scorzato","Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)","In recent years, the question of the reliability of Machine Learning (ML) methods has acquired significant importance, and the analysis of the associated uncertainties has motivated a growing amount of research. However, most of these studies have applied standard error analysis to ML models, and in particular Deep Neural Network (DNN) models, which represent a rather significant departure from standard scientific modelling. It is therefore necessary to integrate the standard error analysis with a deeper epistemological analysis of the possible differences between DNN models and standard scientific modelling and the possible implications of these differences in the assessment of reliability. This article offers several contributions. First, it emphasises the ubiquitous role of model assumptions (both in ML and traditional Science) against the illusion of theory-free science. Secondly, model assumptions are analysed from the point of view of their (epistemic) complexity, which is shown to be language-independent. It is argued that the high epistemic complexity of DNN models hinders the estimate of their reliability and also their prospect of long-term progress. Some potential ways forward are suggested. Thirdly, this article identifies the close relation between a model's epistemic complexity and its interpretability, as introduced in the context of responsible AI. This clarifies in which sense, and to what extent, the lack of understanding of a model (black-box problem) impacts its interpretability in a way that is independent of individual skills. It also clarifies how interpretability is a precondition for assessing the reliability of any model, which cannot be based on statistical analysis alone. This article focuses on the comparison between traditional scientific models and DNN models. But, Random Forest and Logistic Regression models are also briefly considered.","Sun, 14 Jan 2024 20:14:07 UTC (39 KB)[v2] Wed, 31 Jan 2024 21:46:10 UTC (39 KB)"

In this paper, I aim to show, in a minimally technical way, that none of them fully explains the notion of causation appropriate for AQFT because they only capture some of the desiderata for relativistic causation I state or because it is often unclear how each axiom implements its respective desideratum. After this diagnostic, I will show that a fourth condition, local primitive causality (LPC), fully characterizes relativistic causation in the sense of fulfilling all the relevant desiderata. However, it only encompasses the virtues of the other axioms because it is implied by them, as I will show from a construction by Haag and Schroer (1962). Since the conjunction of the three causal axioms implies LPC and other important results in QFT that LPC does not imply, and since LPC helps clarify some of the shortcomings of the three axioms, I advocate for a holistic interpretation of how the axioms characterize the causal structure of AQFT against the strategy in the literature to rivalize the axioms and privilege one among them.","Fri, 12 Jan 2024 11:00:28 UTC (53 KB)[v2] Tue, 5 Mar 2024 12:43:52 UTC (32 KB)"
"111","The Effect of Value-Focused Discussions on Scientists' Ethical Decision Making","Tyler Garcia, Bill Bridges, Caitlin Solis, Caleb Linville, Wyatt Jones, Scott Tanona, Jonathan Herington, James T. Laverty","Physics Education (physics.ed-ph)","Many scientists view science as value-free, despite the fact that both epistemic and non-epistemic values structure scientific inquiry. Current ethics training usually focuses on transmitting knowledge about high-level ethical concepts or rules and is widely regarded as ineffective. We argue that ethics training will be more effective at improving ethical decision making if it focuses on connecting values to science. We pull from philosophy and psychology to define ethical decision making using the Four Component Model. This model states that in order to make an ethical decision someone must consider four components: moral sensitivity, moral reasoning, moral motivation, and moral implementation. We formed a moderated fellowship of fourteen science faculty from different disciplines who met for ten sessions over the course of a year, where they discussed the values embedded in different scientific norms. We then conducted interviews before and after the year-long fellowship that involved guided reflection of scenarios where there was some kind of ethical misconduct where the scientific practice required value judgements (e.g using unpublished data in their own work). We looked at how the fellowship affected the scientists' ability to recognize ethical dimensions regarding the scenarios. We found that this fellowship improved moral sensitivity, but their moral reasoning does not improve. We outlined our approach on how to look at scientists' ethical decision making and made recommendations on how to improve our approach. This work can inform future ethical training to align better with what scientists value and introduce useful concepts from philosophy and psychology to education research in physics.","Thu, 11 Jan 2024 23:16:14 UTC (268 KB)"

Bibliotechnism, the Novel Reference Problem, and the Attitudes of LLMs","Harvey Lederman, Kyle Mahowald","Computation and Language (cs.CL)","Are LLMs cultural technologies like photocopiers or printing presses, which transmit information but cannot create new content? A challenge for this idea, which we call bibliotechnism, is that LLMs often generate entirely novel text. We begin (Part I) with a sustained defense of bibliotechnism against this challenge showing how even entirely novel text may be meaningful only in a derivative sense, and arguing that, in particular, much novel text generated by LLMs is only derivatively meaningful. But we argue (Part II) that bibliotechnism faces a different, novel challenge, stemming from examples in which LLMs generate ""novel reference"", using novel names to refer to novel entities. Such examples could be smoothly explained if LLMs were not cultural technologies but possessed a limited form of agency (beliefs, desires, and intentions). According to interpretationism in the philosophy of mind, a system has beliefs, desires and intentions if and only if its behavior is well explained by the hypothesis that it has such states. So, according to interpretationism, cases of novel reference provide evidence that LLMs have beliefs, desires, and intentions. Given that interpretationism is a live hypothesis about the nature of these states, we suggest that cases of novel reference provide evidence that LLMs do have beliefs, desires, and intentions.","Wed, 10 Jan 2024 00:05:45 UTC (34 KB)[v2] Thu, 15 Feb 2024 22:02:32 UTC (39 KB)"

Stochastic particles described by the Klein-Gordon equation are shown to undergo a classical diffusion process in spacetime coordinates, which is seen by transforming the quantum Cauchy-momentum equations to a Lagrangian frame of reference. Since the quantum potential term is removed under this transformation, the equations for momentum propagation along particle trajectories assume a classical form. A local stochastic de Broglie-Bohm interpretation for the Klein-Gordon system can subsequently be derived. We also introduce the concept of momentum equivariance to replace the second-order Bohm-Newton equations of motion, which break down due to non-linear terms of the stochastic Lagrangian derivative.","Mon, 8 Jan 2024 18:51:38 UTC (26 KB)"

The system of equations provide a local description of quantum mechanics, which is enabled by the inherently retrocausal nature of stochastic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations. We also investigate the stochastic transformation of the classical system, where is it shown that quantum mechanics with the quantum potential reduced by a factor of $\frac{1}{2}$ has a classical representation, which may have interesting implications. Finally, we discuss the notion of a subsystem correspondence principle, which constrains the ontology of the total quantum system.","Mon, 8 Jan 2024 18:43:40 UTC (26 KB)"

This has prompted ongoing disagreements about the extent to which we can meaningfully ascribe any kind of linguistic or cognitive competence to language models. Such questions have deep philosophical roots, echoing longstanding debates about the status of artificial neural networks as cognitive models. This article -- the first part of two companion papers -- serves both as a primer on language models for philosophers, and as an opinionated survey of their significance in relation to classic debates in the philosophy cognitive science, artificial intelligence, and linguistics. We cover topics such as compositionality, language acquisition, semantic competence, grounding, world models, and the transmission of cultural knowledge. We argue that the success of language models challenges several long-held assumptions about artificial neural networks. However, we also highlight the need for further empirical investigation to better understand their internal mechanisms. This sets the stage for the companion paper (Part II), which turns to novel empirical methods for probing the inner workings of language models, and new philosophical questions prompted by their latest developments.","Mon, 8 Jan 2024 14:12:31 UTC (1,347 KB)"

Conventionally, trustworthy AI literature relies on the probabilistic framework and calibration as prerequisites for trustworthiness. In this work, we depart from this viewpoint by proposing a novel trust framework inspired by the philosophy literature on trust. We present a precise mathematical definition of trustworthiness, termed $\mathcal{U}$-trustworthiness, specifically tailored for a subset of tasks aimed at maximizing a utility function. We argue that a model's $\mathcal{U}$-trustworthiness is contingent upon its ability to maximize Bayes utility within this task subset. Our first set of results challenges the probabilistic framework by demonstrating its potential to favor less trustworthy models and introduce the risk of misleading trustworthiness assessments. Within the context of $\mathcal{U}$-trustworthiness, we prove that properly-ranked models are inherently $\mathcal{U}$-trustworthy. Furthermore, we advocate for the adoption of the AUC metric as the preferred measure of trustworthiness. By offering both theoretical guarantees and experimental validation, AUC enables robust evaluation of trustworthiness, thereby enhancing model selection and hyperparameter tuning to yield more trustworthy outcomes.","Thu, 4 Jan 2024 04:58:02 UTC (398 KB)"

In this note we proceed towards unification the relational quantum mechanics of Rovelli, Bohmian mechanics, and many worlds interpretation on the basis so called Dendrogramic Holographic Theory (DHT). DHT is based on the representation of observed events by dendrograms (finite trees) presenting observers subjective image of universe. Dendrograms encode the relational hierarchy between events, in applications they are generated by clustering algorithms; an algorithm with the branching index p >1 generate p-adic trees. The infinite p-adic tree represents the ontic event universe. We consider an ensemble of observers performing observations on each other and representing them by p-adic trees. In such observers universe we introduce a kind of Minkowski space structure, which is statistical by its nature. This model unites the observer/system discrepancy. Measurements are performed by observers on observers. Such observers universe is dynamically changing and is background independent since the space itself is emergent. And within this model, we unify the aforementioned interpretations.","Thu, 28 Sep 2023 18:54:52 UTC (1,101 KB)"

Since being commissioned for a similar task seemed unlikely for me as an aspiring design economist, I developed my own minimalist approach to market design. Using the policy objectives of stakeholders, my approach creates a new institution from the existing one with minimal interference with its elements that compromise the objectives. Minimalist market design initially evolved through my integrated research and policy efforts in school choice from 1997 to 2005 and in kidney exchange from 2003 to 2007. Given its success in school choice and kidney exchange, I systematically followed this approach in many other, often unusual real-world settings. In recent years, my efforts in minimalist market design led to the 2021 reform of the US Army's branching system for its cadets to military specialties, the adoption of reserve systems during the Covid-19 pandemic for vaccine allocation in 15 states and therapies in 2 states, and the deployment of a highly efficient liver exchange system in Türkiye. This same methodology also predicted the rescission of a 1995 Supreme Court judgment in India, resulting in countless litigations and interruptions of public recruitment for 25 years, as well as the mandates of its replacement. In this monograph, I describe the philosophy, evolution, and successful applications of minimalist market design, contrasting it with the mainstream paradigm for the field. In doing so, I also provide a paradigm for economists who want to influence policy and change institutions through their research.","Sat, 30 Dec 2023 19:44:53 UTC (3,029 KB)"

They are extremely luminous electromagnetic explosions in the Universe observed from cosmological distances. These unique characteristics provide a marvellous chance to study the evolution of massive stars and probe the rarely explored early Universe. In addition, the central source's compactness and the high bulk Lorentz factor in GRB's ultra-relativistic jets make them efficient laboratories for studying high-energy astrophysics. GRBs are the only astrophysical sources observed in two distinct signals: gravitational and electromagnetic waves. GRBs are believed to be produced from a ""fireball"" moving at a relativistic speed, launched by a fast-rotating black hole or magnetar. GRBs emit radiation in two phases: the initial gamma/hard X-rays prompt emission, the duration of which ranges from a few seconds to hours, followed by the multi-wavelength and long-lived afterglow phase. Based on the observed time frame of GRB prompt emission, astronomers have generally categorized GRBs into two groups: long (> 2 s) and short (< 2 s) bursts. Despite the discovery of GRBs in the late 1960s, their origin is still a great mystery. There are several open questions related to GRBs, such as: What powers the GRBs jets/central engine? What are the possible progenitors? What is the jet composition? What is the underlying emission process that gives rise to observed radiation? Where and how does the energy dissipation occur in the outflow? How to solve the radiative efficiency problem? What are the possible causes of Dark GRBs and orphan afterglows? How to investigate the local environment of GRBs? etc. In this thesis, we explored some of these open enigmas (progenitor, emission mechanisms, jet composition and environment) using multi-wavelength observations obtained using space and ground-based facilities.","Tue, 26 Dec 2023 10:04:31 UTC (33,121 KB)[v2] Mon, 29 Jan 2024 05:08:25 UTC (33,121 KB)"

With great power comes responsibility, so it's imperative that statisticians ensure that the methods being developing to solve these problems are reliable. But reliable in what sense? This question is problematic because different notions of reliability correspond to distinct statistical schools of thought, each with their own philosophy and methodology, often giving different answers in applications. To achieve the goal of reliably solving modern problems, I argue that a balance in the behavioral-statistical priorities is needed. Towards this, I make use of Fisher's ""underworld of probability"" to motivate a new property called invulnerability that, roughly, requires the statistician to avoid the risk of losing money in a long-run sense. Then I go on to make connections between invulnerability and the more familiar behaviorally- and statistically-motivated notions, namely coherence and (frequentist-style) validity.","Fri, 22 Dec 2023 18:47:54 UTC (56 KB)"

In this paper, instead of relying on classical concepts we attempt to infer a conceptualization directly from the mathematics. This reconceptualization leads to a physical reinterpretation of the paths involved in the Standard Model's action integral as traces of an accumulative process that occurs within an ""extraverse"", of which our observable spacetime is a single ""slice"". We briefly outline a rigorous mathematical model which validates the physical reinterpretation, and leads to predictions that are potentially verifiable by experiment. We contrast our model with other popular interpretations of quantum mechanics. We describe some of the metaphysical consequences of our proposed perspective. Finally we present some speculations about an alternative approach that could possibly lead to a more satisfying, intuitively-graspable theory.","Mon, 18 Dec 2023 07:16:04 UTC (1,412 KB)"
"142","On the tensorial structure of general covariant quantum systems","Gabriel M.Carral, Iñaki Garay, Francesca Vidotto","General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)","The definition of a quantum system requires a Hilbert space, a way to define the dynamics, and an algebra of observables. The structure of the observable algebra is related to a tensor product decomposition of the Hilbert space and represents the composition of the system by subsystems. It has been remarked that the Hamiltonian may determine this tensor product structure. Here we observe that this fact may lead to questionable consequences in some cases, and does extend to the more general background-independent case, where the Hamiltonian is replaced by a Hamiltonian constraint. These observations reinforces the idea that specifying the observables and the way they interplay with the dynamics, is essential to define a quantum theory. We also reflect on the general role that system decomposition has in the quantum theory.","Wed, 20 Dec 2023 19:03:23 UTC (28 KB)"
"143","Explainable artificial intelligence approaches for brain-computer interfaces: a review and design space","Param Rajpura, Hubert Cecotti, Yogesh Kumar Meena","Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC)","This review paper provides an integrated perspective of Explainable Artificial Intelligence techniques applied to Brain-Computer Interfaces. BCIs use predictive models to interpret brain signals for various high-stake applications. However, achieving explainability in these complex models is challenging as it compromises accuracy. The field of XAI has emerged to address the need for explainability across various stakeholders, but there is a lack of an integrated perspective in XAI for BCI (XAI4BCI) literature. It is necessary to differentiate key concepts like explainability, interpretability, and understanding in this context and formulate a comprehensive framework. To understand the need of XAI for BCI, we pose six key research questions for a systematic review and meta-analysis, encompassing its purposes, applications, usability, and technical feasibility. We employ the PRISMA methodology -- preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses to review (n=1246) and analyze (n=84) studies published in 2015 and onwards for key insights. The results highlight that current research primarily focuses on interpretability for developers and researchers, aiming to justify outcomes and enhance model performance. We discuss the unique approaches, advantages, and limitations of XAI4BCI from the literature. We draw insights from philosophy, psychology, and social sciences. We propose a design space for XAI4BCI, considering the evolving need to visualize and investigate predictive model outcomes customised for various stakeholders in the BCI development and deployment lifecycle. This paper is the first to focus solely on reviewing XAI4BCI research articles. This systematic review and meta-analysis findings with the proposed design space prompt important discussions on establishing standards for BCI explanations, highlighting current limitations, and guiding the future of XAI in BCI.","Wed, 20 Dec 2023 13:56:31 UTC (2,676 KB)"
"144","Robust Machine Learning by Transforming and Augmenting Imperfect Training Data","Elliot Creager","Machine Learning (cs.LG)","Machine Learning (ML) is an expressive framework for turning data into computer programs. Across many problem domains -- both in industry and policy settings -- the types of computer programs needed for accurate prediction or optimal control are difficult to write by hand. On the other hand, collecting instances of desired system behavior may be relatively more feasible. This makes ML broadly appealing, but also induces data sensitivities that often manifest as unexpected failure modes during deployment. In this sense, the training data available tend to be imperfect for the task at hand. This thesis explores several data sensitivities of modern machine learning and how to address them. We begin by discussing how to prevent ML from codifying prior human discrimination measured in the training data, where we take a fair representation learning approach. We then discuss the problem of learning from data containing spurious features, which provide predictive fidelity during training but are unreliable upon deployment. Here we observe that insofar as standard training methods tend to learn such features, this propensity can be leveraged to search for partitions of training data that expose this inconsistency, ultimately promoting learning algorithms invariant to spurious features. Finally, we turn our attention to reinforcement learning from data with insufficient coverage over all possible states and actions. To address the coverage issue, we discuss how causal priors can be used to model the single-step dynamics of the setting where data are collected. This enables a new type of data augmentation where observed trajectories are stitched together to produce new but plausible counterfactual trajectories.","Tue, 19 Dec 2023 20:49:28 UTC (28,434 KB)"
"145","Beyond Fairness: Alternative Moral Dimensions for Assessing Algorithms and Designing Systems","Kimi Wenzel, Geoff Kaufman, Laura Dabbish","Computers and Society (cs.CY)","The ethics of artificial intelligence (AI) systems has risen as an imminent concern across scholarly communities. This concern has propagated a great interest in algorithmic fairness. Large research agendas are now devoted to increasing algorithmic fairness, assessing algorithmic fairness, and understanding human perceptions of fairness. We argue that there is an overreliance on fairness as a single dimension of morality, which comes at the expense of other important human values. Drawing from moral psychology, we present five moral dimensions that go beyond fairness, and suggest three ways these alternative dimensions may contribute to ethical AI development.","Tue, 19 Dec 2023 19:54:11 UTC (35 KB)"
"146","The DSA Transparency Database: Auditing Self-reported Moderation Actions by Social Media","Amaury Trujillo, Tiziano Fagni, Stefano Cresci","Social and Information Networks (cs.SI)","Since September 2023, the Digital Services Act (DSA) obliges large online platforms to submit detailed data on each moderation action they take within the European Union (EU) to the DSA Transparency Database. From its inception, this centralized database has sparked scholarly interest as an unprecedented and potentially unique trove of data on real-world online moderation. Here, we thoroughly analyze all 353.12M records submitted by the eight largest social media platforms in the EU during the first 100 days of the database. Specifically, we conduct a platform-wise comparative study of their: volume of moderation actions, grounds for decision, types of applied restrictions, types of moderated content, timeliness in undertaking and submitting moderation actions, and use of automation. Furthermore, we systematically cross-check the contents of the database with the platforms' own transparency reports. Our analyses reveal that (i) the platforms adhered only in part to the philosophy and structure of the database, (ii) the structure of the database is partially inadequate for the platforms' reporting needs, (iii) the platforms exhibited substantial differences in their moderation actions, (iv) a remarkable fraction of the database data is inconsistent, (v) the platform X (formerly Twitter) presents the most inconsistencies. Our findings have far-reaching implications for policymakers and scholars across diverse disciplines. They offer guidance for future regulations that cater to the reporting needs of online platforms in general, but also highlight opportunities to improve and refine the database itself.","Sat, 16 Dec 2023 00:02:49 UTC (101 KB)[v2] Sat, 20 Jan 2024 13:59:09 UTC (207 KB)"

It is the cornerstone of the cognitive skills and exploring university student's happiness has been the essence of the researchers lately. In this study, we have analyzed the university student's happiness and its facets using statistical distribution charts; designing research questions. Furthermore, regression analysis, machine learning, and clustering algorithms were applied on the world happiness dataset and university student's dataset for training and testing respectively. Philosophy was the happiest department while Sociology the saddest; average happiness score being 2.8 and 2.44 respectively. Pearson coefficient of correlation was 0.74 for Health. Predicted happiness score was 5.2 and the goodness of model fit was 51%. train and test error being 0.52, 0.47 respectively. On a Confidence Interval(CI) of 5% p-value was least for Campus Environment(CE) and University Reputation(UR) and maximum for Extra-curricular Activities(ECA) and Work Balance(WB) (i.e. 0.184 and 0.228 respectively). RF with Clustering got the highest accuracy(89%) and F score(0.98) and the least error(17.91%), hence turned out to be best for our study","Thu, 14 Dec 2023 06:28:31 UTC (1,690 KB)"
"149","Assessing LLMs for Moral Value Pluralism","Noam Benkler, Drisana Mosaphir, Scott Friedman, Andrew Smart, Sonja Schmer-Galunder","Computation and Language (cs.CL)","The fields of AI current lacks methods to quantitatively assess and potentially alter the moral values inherent in the output of large language models (LLMs). However, decades of social science research has developed and refined widely-accepted moral value surveys, such as the World Values Survey (WVS), eliciting value judgments from direct questions in various geographies. We have turned those questions into value statements and use NLP to compute to how well popular LLMs are aligned with moral values for various demographics and cultures. While the WVS is accepted as an explicit assessment of values, we lack methods for assessing implicit moral and cultural values in media, e.g., encountered in social media, political rhetoric, narratives, and generated by AI systems such as LLMs that are increasingly present in our daily lives. As we consume online content and utilize LLM outputs, we might ask, which moral values are being implicitly promoted or undercut, or -- in the case of LLMs -- if they are intending to represent a cultural identity, are they doing so consistently? In this paper we utilize a Recognizing Value Resonance (RVR) NLP model to identify WVS values that resonate and conflict with a given passage of output text. We apply RVR to the text generated by LLMs to characterize implicit moral values, allowing us to quantify the moral/cultural distance between LLMs and various demographics that have been surveyed using the WVS. In line with other work we find that LLMs exhibit several Western-centric value biases; they overestimate how conservative people in non-Western countries are, they are less accurate in representing gender for non-Western countries, and portray older populations as having more traditional values. Our results highlight value misalignment and age groups, and a need for social science informed technological solutions addressing value plurality in LLMs.","Fri, 8 Dec 2023 16:18:15 UTC (623 KB)"

With its exceptional capacity to capture complex contextual relationships, the LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI) family represents a novel advancement in the field of natural language processing by releasing foundational models designed to improve the natural language understanding abilities of the transformer architecture thanks to their large amount of trainable parameters (7, 13, and 70 billion parameters). In many natural language understanding tasks, these models obtain the same performances as private company models such as OpenAI Chat-GPT with the advantage to make publicly available weights and code for research and commercial uses. In this work, we investigate the possibility of Language Adaptation for LLaMA models, explicitly focusing on addressing the challenge of Italian Language coverage. Adopting an open science approach, we explore various tuning approaches to ensure a high-quality text generated in Italian suitable for common tasks in this underrepresented language in the original models' datasets. We aim to release effective text generation models with strong linguistic properties for many tasks that seem challenging using multilingual or general-purpose LLMs. By leveraging an open science philosophy, this study contributes to Language Adaptation strategies for the Italian language by introducing the novel LLaMAntino family of Italian LLMs.","Fri, 15 Dec 2023 18:06:22 UTC (554 KB)"
