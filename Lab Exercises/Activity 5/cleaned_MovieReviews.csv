like it hot can certainly stand on its own merit with or without my thunderous round of applause  more than a decade ago i had the privilege of performing both the tony curtis and jack lemmon roles in

the musical nevertheless is still a big hit with live audiences  i cant remember ever having a better time on stage than i did with sugar and its all due to the irrepressible talents that instigated

the st valentines day massacre  barely escaping with their lives their instruments arent quite as lucky our panicky twosome is forced to take it on the lam  scared out of their shoes sorry the boys don heels and dresses after they connect with an allgirl orchestra tour headed for sunny florida  killing two birds with one stone they figure why not go south for the winter while dodging the mob  once they hit the coast theyll ditch both the band and their humiliating outfits  enter a major detour in the form of  luscious marilyn monroe as sugar kane given one of the sexiest yet innocent entrances ever afforded a star snugly fit in flashy jazz age threads a blast from the locomotives engine taunts her incredible hourglass figure as she rushes to catch her train to florida  the boys stopped dead in their highheeled tracks by this gorgeous vision decide maybe the gig might not be so bad after all as the totally unreliable but engagingly freespirited vocalistukelele player for the band sugar gets instantly chummy with the girls when they cover for her after getting caught with a flask of booze  as things progress complications naturally set in  playboy curtis falls for monroe but has his josephine guise to contend with while lemmons daphne has to deal with the persistently amorous attentions of a handsy older millionaire  what results is an uproarious marx brotherslike farce with mistaken identities burlesquestyled antics and a madcap chase finale all under the exact supervision of director billy wilder who also cowrote the script  lemmon and curtis pull off the silly shenanigans with customary flair and are such a great team you almost wish they ended up together curtis does a deadon cary grant imitation while posing as a shell oil millionaire to impress marilyn lemmon induces campy hilarity in his scenes with lecherous joe e brown who also gets to deliver the films blueribbon closing line  as for the immortal monroe she is at her zenith here as the bubbly vacuous zowielooking flapper looking for love in all the wrong places  despite her golddigging instincts monroes sugar is cozy vulnerable and altogether loveable getting a lot of mileage too out of her solo singing spots which include the kinetic running wild the torchy im through with love and her classic boopboopadoop signature song i wanna be loved by youthe film is dotted with fun atmospheric characters   pat obrien and george raft both get to spoof their warner bros stereotypes as cop vs gangster joan shawlee shows off a bit of her stinger as the bytherules bandleader sweet sue mike mazurki overplays delightfully the archetypal dimbulbed henchman and if im not mistaken i think thats young billy gray of father knows best fame the role is not listed in the credits playing a snappy pintsized bellhop who comes on strong with the girlsfor those headscratchers who cant figure out why the socalled mild humor of some like it hot is considered such a classic today i can only presume that they have been brought up on or excessively numbed by the graphic mindless toilet humor of presentday comedies  there was a time when going for a laugh had subtlety and purity  it relied on wit timing inventiveness and suggestion  not shock or grossout value  its the difference between sid caesar and andrew dice clay between tony curtis and jack lemmon and chris farley and david spade between i love lucy and married with children between lemmons novel use of maracas in the hilarious engagement sequence and cameron diazs use of hair gel in a scene that anybody could have made funny  jack lemmon could do more with a pair of maracas than most actors today could do with a whole roomful of props  while some like it hot bristles with clever sexual innuendo todays insult comedies are inundated with inyourface sexual assault which after awhile gets quite tiresome  lacking any kind of finesse and leaving absolutely nothing to the imagination  i still have hopehaving ultimate faith in my fellow film devotees that is why some like it hot will and should be considered one of the screwball classics of all time and why most of todays attempts will and should be yesterdays news","18

the musical nevertheless is still a big hit with live audiences  i cant remember ever having a better time on stage than i did with sugar and its all due to the irrepressible talents that instigated

once they hit the coast theyll ditch both the band and their humiliating outfits  enter a major detour in the form of  luscious marilyn monroe as sugar kane given one of the sexiest yet innocent entrances ever afforded a star snugly fit in flashy jazz age threads a blast from the locomotives engine taunts her incredible hourglass figure as she rushes to catch her train to florida  the boys

but has his josephine guise to contend with while lemmons daphne has to deal with the persistently amorous attentions of a handsy older millionaire  what results is an uproarious marx brotherslike farce with mistaken identities burlesquestyled antics and a madcap chase finale all under the exact supervision of director billy wilder who also cowrote the script  lemmon and curtis pull off the silly shenanigans with customary flair and are such a great team you almost wish they ended up together curtis does a deadon cary grant imitation while posing as a shell oil millionaire to impress marilyn lemmon induces campy hilarity in his scenes with lecherous joe e brown who also gets to deliver the films blueribbon closing line  as for the immortal monroe she is at her zenith here as the

a snappy pintsized bellhop who comes on strong with the girlsfor those headscratchers who cant figure out why the socalled mild humor of some like it hot is considered such a classic today i can only presume that they have been brought up on or excessively numbed by the graphic mindless toilet humor of presentday comedies  there was a time when going for a laugh had subtlety and purity  it relied on wit timing inventiveness and suggestion  not shock or grossout value  its the difference between sid caesar and andrew dice clay between tony curtis and jack lemmon and chris farley and david spade between i love lucy and married with children between lemmons novel use of maracas in the hilarious engagement sequence and cameron diazs use of hair gel in a scene that anybody could have made funny  jack lemmon could do more with a pair of maracas than most actors today could do with a whole roomful of props  while some like it hot bristles with clever sexual innuendo todays insult comedies are inundated with inyourface sexual assault which after awhile gets quite tiresome  lacking any kind of finesse and leaving absolutely nothing to the imagination  i still have hopehaving ultimate faith

they become frazzled or nervous while frantically tapping their hearts they know that reciting the oversimplifying phrase will not provide their problems with a solution or even a catalyst but it gives them the onset courage they desperately need at a time of uncertainty and despair one character even tries to use the line after an amateurishlygiven birth may have gone terribly wrong its times like that when the saying may not be so effective even if its goal is not to provide certain reliefbut all is well as they so often say rajkumar hiranis  idiots my introduction to the world of bollywood cinema is a comedydrama unlike any one ive ever seen long but never drawn out frantic but never desperate and emotional but never manipulating it provides us with three of the most likable characters of the last decade and with insight to the culture of indians and their parents rarely has a comedy had this big of a brain in its head and a canvas of opportunities in mind while possessing a title not even fit for a farceour title characters are ambitious but stunted farhan qureshi r madhavan jittery fearful raju rastogi sharman joshi and borderline prodigy ranchhoddas rancho shamaldas chhanchad aamir khan three close friends who attend the imperial college of engineering ice one of indias most prestigious colleges where only the best are accepted the young boys already are facing some of lifes greatest challenges all of them pursuing the field of engineering when the only one who seems to have a passion for the material is rancho farhan was forced to become skilled in the field because of his strict father and raju is pursuing the field with the goal of getting his family out of poverty with his fathers expensive health bills his mothers fragile core and his sisters inability to marry all on the table rancho is studying because he feels that one should pursue passion and make a career out of it so it doesnt feel like work if youre passionate and devoted to your work success will find you  yet this is only one of the countless morals and insights  idiots provide its viewer withthe film chronicles their issues in college in flashback with instances in the presence popping up to show farhan and raju searching for their pal rancho who has disappeared and avoided contact for several years now this is not your typical flashback film however it uses this method much to its advantage and doesnt feel like a narrative within a narrative it seals both stories nicely but it takes the viewer on a rollercoaster ride of emotions through carefully constructed events before it even arrives at those endingsone of their problems in college is the professordean of the campus viru sahastrabuddhe boman irani who the three derogatorily call virus when his back is turned virus is strict and often largely unsympathetic to the problems of his students which allows the film to explore a dark topic one assumes a comedy wouldnt dare cross paths with and that is the issue of indian teen suicide one kid had his father have a stroke rendering him unable to focus on academics for months falling gravely behind virus is grossly unsympathetic to his case denying him an extension on a project hes work so unrealistically hard on but can not perfectif anything we can say  idiots is a message to the parents of the indian youth and that is to stop applying pressure to an already stressed out demographic ive read several articles articulating the point that indian teenagers are among one of the highest in suicide rates and that many parents put an unrealistic amount of pressure duty and responsibility on the child to the point of a physical and mental collapse youre given the unalienable freedom to raise your kids with the method you choose but not every method is perfect and when your method is one of the ones that leads to suicide mental health problems and perpetuates fear and anxiety in the minds of teenagers then you may want to reevaluate your methods idiots also provides us with the idea that many indian children are told what to become in life early and are discouraged from exploration or even personal ambition this i cant believe what an unhappy uninspiring completely wasted life to slog through everyday doing something you loathe all because it was the lucky career choice of your parents yet im sure millions have been lead through this same life its the worst way of living through a person that i can imaginethe film runs ten minutes shy of three hours which for few viewers may seem too long and uncomfortable i was skeptical myself walking in rather blind almost every bollywood film ive conducted research on seems to run an upwards of three hours some extending and testing the waters to roughly five hours if other bollywood works have characters drawn along the same lines of being relatable human and easily accessible and not biased towards race or social class i cant see it being a struggle to get through any of the industrys filmsthrough every quickwitted song and dance number through every comedic scene through every instance of dramatic despair emotionally alive moment solemnly poignant sequence suspenseful setup to a lovely heartfelt conclusion  idiots is a wonderful invaluable endeavor in the world of film its actors are beautifully fitting for their roles assisted by a script so human and true to life that it is honestly hard to believe and captured through beautifully alive cinematography to collectively give us a beautiful package not just in the figurative sense this is arguably one of the best comedies ive ever seen","3 january 2013","10/10",2013-01-03,NA

946,"amélie (2001)","hearthwarming","perica","to start off with i heard a lot of good things about this movie when it was on the big screens but never got around to see it before it disappeared sitting here long after in the aftermath i might never forgive myself for missing that opportunity eventually i did get around to see it though a small tv never does a film the same justice a theater does and being a bit sceptic about the small hype this movie caused made me prejudice about it but i must say i have never been so wrong before and i am happy saying itthis movies biggest crime and yet its biggest asset is that it is in french subtitles just does not bring full justice to a movie like this and it is bound to scare off most of the audience not used to subtitled movies sad to say so but i believe it is the truth i do not know any french at all but i sure wish i was fluent watching this moviecompared to most other films amelie and i will stick to amelie since le fabuleux destin damlie poulain is a bit long to write is based on a rather ordinary and plain story everyone can relate to but it is given to us in a very special kind of way mixed with wonderful little subplots and an almost chaotic amount of details we get to see and experience the world and especially paris through the filtering eyes and fantasy of amelie a paris that might feel small and limited on the screen but in fact is just as big as it is in the eyes of ameliedirector jeanpierre jeunet brings to life the world of amelie with colors masterful camerawork and a few special effects well i have certainly felt like melting a couple of times too in my life some people i spoke to before seeing amelie criticized it for being too childish and unrealistic but i believe it is an essential part of the movie since amelie herself is a very childish and imaginative young girl she just happens to fall in love one day when she decides to embark on a quest jeanpierre jeunet manages to bring us along without losing control of the set or the plot it is exactly this kind of movie that could easily be overdone and lose all of its magic in the hands of the wrong person but jeanpierre jeunet never slips a single time for you who think you never heard of him before he is actually the same man who brought us alien  back in  i still refuse to believe he was involved in that horrible film and the wonderful delicatessen in audrey tautou could not be overemphasized for her importance in portraying amelie i am a bit embarrassed admitting it but i was almost falling in love with amelie myself forgetting she was only fiction on the screen however she does not carry amelie solely by herself the cast makes an excellent whole and it is hard imagining switching anyone without affecting the whole outcome everyone manages to make the most out of their role and even though we only get to know some of them briefly they come alive just as much as amelie herself doesi could go on forever about amelie it contains so many details and switches in tempo and camerawork it has to be seen more than once to take in and understand everything damn it amelie made me happy laughing out loud at times and very few movies affects me like thati very rarely give movies a  and i was indeed considering a  for a while but for me this is one of those movies i will come back to time after time long after the cg thrills of hyped fantasy movies and big budget hollywood productions have faded and been forgotten amelie will still be jumping around in my heart doing all those silly and charming little things i wish i dared to do too","20 july 2018","10/10",2018-07-20,NA

man and combine this with the second part of his last name son and add a little creativity you will come up with the combination son of man which was a title jesus came up with about himself also the first time we meet neo a man calls him and i quote youre my saviour man my own personal jesus christ it doesnt get any more obvious than that aside from the christianic elements the film also gets its inspiration from budhism gnosticism gnosis  knowledge but is also inspired by plato and his analogy of the cave and jean baudrillards essay simulacra and simulations explaining these elements would

man and combine this with the second part of his last name son and add a little creativity you will come up with the combination son of man which was a title jesus came up with about himself also the first time we meet neo a man calls him and i quote youre my saviour man my own personal jesus christ it doesnt get any more obvious than that aside from the christianic elements the film also gets its

their way to work other than the comic payoff at the end of the scene in which they use parts of this conversation to taunt their victims their talk has no relevance to anything in the film or to anything else for that matter yet without such scenes pulp fiction wouldnt be pulp fiction i get the sense that tarantino put into the film whatever struck his fancy and somehow the final product is not only coherent but wonderfully texturedits no wonder that fans spend so much time debating what was in the suitcase reading far more into the story than tarantino probably intended the film is so intricately structured with so many astonishing details many of which you wont pick up on the first viewing that it seems to cry out for some deeper explanation but there is no deeper explanation pulp fiction is as the title indicates purely an exercise in technique and style albeit a brilliant and layered one containing numerous references to other films it is like a great work of abstract art or art about art it has all the characteristics we associate with great movies fine writing firstrate acting unforgettable characters and one of the most wellconstructed narratives ive ever seen in a film but to what end the selfcontained story does not seem to have bearing on anything but itselfthe movie becomes a bit easier to understand once you realize that its essentially a black comedy dressed up as a crime drama each of the three main story threads begins with a situation that could easily form the subplot of any standard gangster movie but something always goes wrong some small unexpected accident that causes the whole situation to come tumbling down leading the increasingly desperate characters to absurd measures tarantinos originality stems from his ability to focus on small details and follow them where they lead even if they move the story away from conventional plot developmentsperhaps no screenplay has ever found a better use for digressions indeed the whole film seems to consist of digressions no character ever says anything in a simple straightforward manner jules could have simply told yolanda be cool and no ones going to get hurt which is just the type of line youd find in a generic runofthemill action flick instead he goes off on a tangent about what fonzie is like tarantino savors every word of his characters finding a potential wisecrack in every statement and infusing the dialogue with clever pop culture references but the lines arent just witty they are full of intelligent observations about human behavior think of mias statement to vincent thats when you know youve found somebody special when you can just shut the f up for a minute and comfortably enjoy the silencewhat is the movies purpose exactly im not sure but it does deal a lot with the theme of power marsellus is the sort of character who looms over the entire film while being invisible most of the time the whole point of the big date sequence which happens to be my favorite section of the film is the power that marsellus has over his men without even being present this power is what gets vincent to act in ways you would not ordinarily expect from a dumb stoned gangster faced with an attractive woman whose husband has gone away the power theme also helps explain one of the more controversial aspects of the film its liberal use of the nword in this film the word isnt just used as an epithet to describe blacks jules for instance at one point applies the term to vincent it has more to do with power than with race the powerful characters utter the word to express their dominance over weaker characters most of these gangsters are not racist in practice indeed they are intermingled racially and have achieved a level of equality that surpasses the habits of many lawabiding citizens in our society they resort to racial epithets because its a patter that establishes their separateness from the noncriminal worldtheres a nice moral progression to the stories we presume that vincent hesitates to sleep with mia out of fear rather than loyalty later butchs act of heroism could be motivated by honor but were never sure the film ends however with jules making a clear moral choice thus the movie seems to be exploring whether violent outlaws can act other than for selfpreservationstill its hard to find much of a larger meaning tying together these

word isnt just used as an epithet to describe blacks jules for instance at one point applies the term to vincent it has more to do with power than with race the powerful characters utter the word to express their dominance over weaker characters most of these gangsters are not racist in practice indeed they are intermingled racially and have achieved a level of equality that surpasses the habits of many lawabiding citizens in our society they resort to racial epithets because its a patter that establishes their separateness from the noncriminal worldtheres a nice moral progression to the stories we presume that vincent hesitates to sleep with mia out of fear rather than loyalty later butchs act of heroism could be motivated by honor but were never sure the film ends however with jules making a clear moral choice thus the movie seems to be exploring whether violent outlaws can act other than for selfpreservationstill its hard to find much of a larger meaning tying together these eccentric set of stories none of the stories are really about anything they certainly are not about hitmen pontificating about burgers nor is the film really a satire or a farce although it contains elements of both at times it feels like a tale that didnt need to be told but for whatever reason this movie tells it and does a better job than most films of its kind or of any other kind","17

dialogue is witty and entertaining and its also disarming because it makes these two thugs seem all too normal if you didnt know better you might assume these were regular guys having chitchat on their way to work other than the comic payoff at the end of the scene in which they use parts of this conversation to taunt their victims their talk has no relevance to anything in the film or to anything else for that matter yet without such scenes pulp fiction wouldnt be pulp fiction i get the sense that tarantino put into the film whatever struck his fancy and somehow the final product is not only coherent but wonderfully texturedits no wonder that fans spend so much time debating what was in the suitcase reading far more into the story than tarantino probably intended the film is so intricately structured with so many astonishing details many of which you wont pick up on the first viewing that it seems to cry out for some deeper explanation but there is no deeper explanation pulp fiction is as the title indicates purely an exercise in technique and style albeit a brilliant and layered one containing numerous references to other films it is like a great work of abstract art or art about art it has all the characteristics we associate with great movies fine writing firstrate acting unforgettable characters and one of the most wellconstructed narratives ive ever seen in a film but to what end the selfcontained story does not seem to have bearing on anything but itselfthe movie becomes a bit easier to understand once you realize that its essentially a black comedy dressed up as a crime drama each of the three main story threads begins with a situation that could easily form the subplot of any standard gangster movie but something always goes wrong some small unexpected accident that causes the whole situation to come tumbling down leading the increasingly desperate characters to absurd measures tarantinos originality stems from his ability to focus on small details and follow them where they lead even if they move the story away from conventional plot developmentsperhaps no screenplay has ever found a better use for digressions indeed the whole film seems to consist of digressions no character ever says anything in a simple straightforward manner jules could have simply told yolanda be cool and no ones going to get hurt which is just the type of line youd find in a generic runofthemill action flick instead he goes off on a tangent about what fonzie is like tarantino savors every word of his characters finding a potential wisecrack in every statement and infusing the dialogue with clever pop culture references but the lines arent just witty they are full of intelligent observations about human behavior think of mias statement to vincent thats when you know youve found somebody special when you can just shut the f up for a minute and comfortably enjoy the silencewhat is the movies purpose exactly im not sure but it does deal a

1404,"oppenheimer (i) (2023))","a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws","mrdhwong","oppenheimer is a biographical thriller film written and directed by christopher nolan the dark knight trilogy inception interstellar dunkirk based on the biography american prometheus by kai bird and martin j sherwin starring cillian murphy in the lead role in addition to matt damon robert downey jr emily blunt and florence pugh it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flawsduring the height of the second world war theoretical physicist j robert oppenheimer cillian murphy is recruited by the united states government to oversee the manhattan project a top secret operation intended to develop the worlds first nuclear weapons after becoming acquainted with the projects director major general leslie groves matt damon oppenheimer and the general come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of los alamos new mexico as numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the nazis can devise their own with the war raging and personal troubles mounting oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits but soon suffers the consequences of his dedicationon august th  the atomic bomb little boy was dropped on the japanese city of hiroshima making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war the dropping of this bomb and fat man in nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to world war ii and with it began a frightening new era known as the atomic age to this day it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it the one man whom most people pin all the blame on is j robert oppenheimer whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as the father of the atomic bomb a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life in christopher nolans biopic oppenheimer we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex mans legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades laterin true christopher nolan fashion the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented nonsequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subjects life when we are first introduced to j robert oppenheimer we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers even as a young student however almost immediately after the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him as the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life these scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people this gives the viewer a first person perspective of what oppenheimers mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials its hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion but nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect mananother notable thing about nolans direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes one moment which i wont speak about in too much detail literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last since nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using cgi in his movies he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs by reminding the audience that the nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game as each bomb explodes it can be likened to a ticking clock with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon the creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace something especially necessary considering the films three hour runtime nolan previously exhibited a similar method in s dunkirk which utilised the films score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence once again nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using cg effects to tell a story and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiencyfor what can only be described as the performance of his career cillian murphy brings everything necessary to the role of j robert oppenheimer a man so complex that i cant imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively the combined efforts of both murphys acting and nolans direction help make oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the th century this is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an indepth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish the film paints oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books murphy approaches him like that of a shakespearian figure rife with flaws haughtiness and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate one scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family he can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history while consequently ushering in something even worsethe rest of the films cast all did a fantastic job as well with the standouts being matt damon robert downey jr emily blunt and florence pugh damons take on major general leslie groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use oppenheimers talents to his advantage we watch as groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power grovess ignorance to oppenheimers extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail to that effect he provides an important third party perspective to oppenheimers achievementsits also great to see robert downey jr shine as lewis strauss which is not only his best postmcu role but one of his best roles in general strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing oppenheimers ties to communism he holds such a grudge against oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story downey takes every opportunity to show strausss twofaced nature biding his time for the right moment to strip oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation reportedly downey considers this his best role to date and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performanceemily blunt and florence pugh also contributed significantly as kitty oppenheimer and jean tatlock respectively each of these two women represent something significant in oppenheimers life with kitty being who he should be with and jean being who he personally wants to be with this draws parallels to that of oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities it can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making sometimes you have no other choiceas a biopic and a christopher nolan film oppenheimer exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields there are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through i guess sometimes all it takes is one brave risktaking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task we need more films like this to inspire thoughtful creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream after all its a tough job but someones got to do it for usi rate it a perfect ","20 july 2023","10/10",2023-07-20,NA

1414,"oppenheimer (i) (2023))","a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws","mrdhwong","oppenheimer is a biographical thriller film written and directed by christopher nolan the dark knight trilogy inception interstellar dunkirk based on the biography american prometheus by kai bird and martin j sherwin starring cillian murphy in the lead role in addition to matt damon robert downey jr emily blunt and florence pugh it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flawsduring the height of the second world war theoretical physicist j robert oppenheimer cillian murphy is recruited by the united states government to oversee the manhattan project a top secret operation intended to develop the worlds first nuclear weapons after becoming acquainted with the projects director major general leslie groves matt damon oppenheimer and the general come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of los alamos new mexico as numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the nazis can devise their own with the war raging and personal troubles mounting oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits but soon suffers the consequences of his dedicationon august th  the atomic bomb little boy was dropped on the japanese city of hiroshima making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war the dropping of this bomb and fat man in nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to world war ii and with it began a frightening new era known as the atomic age to this day it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it the one man whom most people pin all the blame on is j robert oppenheimer whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as the father of the atomic bomb a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life in christopher nolans biopic oppenheimer we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex mans legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades laterin true christopher nolan fashion the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented nonsequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subjects life when we are first introduced to j robert oppenheimer we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers even as a young student however almost immediately after the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him as the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life these scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people this gives the viewer a first person perspective of what oppenheimers mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials its hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion but nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect mananother notable thing about nolans direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes one moment which i wont speak about in too much detail literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last since nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using cgi in his movies he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs by reminding the audience that the nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game as each bomb explodes it can be likened to a ticking clock with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon the creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace something especially necessary considering the films three hour runtime nolan previously exhibited a similar method in s dunkirk which utilised the films score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence once again nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using cg effects to tell a story and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiencyfor what can only be described as the performance of his career cillian murphy brings everything necessary to the role of j robert oppenheimer a man so complex that i cant imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively the combined efforts of both murphys acting and nolans direction help make oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the th century this is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an indepth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish the film paints oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books murphy approaches him like that of a shakespearian figure rife with flaws haughtiness and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate one scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family he can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history while consequently ushering in something even worsethe rest of the films cast all did a fantastic job as well with the standouts being matt damon robert downey jr emily blunt and florence pugh damons take on major general leslie groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use oppenheimers talents to his advantage we watch as groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power grovess ignorance to oppenheimers extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail to that effect he provides an important third party perspective to oppenheimers achievementsits also great to see robert downey jr shine as lewis strauss which is not only his best postmcu role but one of his best roles in general strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing oppenheimers ties to communism he holds such a grudge against oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story downey takes every opportunity to show strausss twofaced nature biding his time for the right moment to strip oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation reportedly downey considers this his best role to date and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performanceemily blunt and florence pugh also contributed significantly as kitty oppenheimer and jean tatlock respectively each of these two women represent something significant in oppenheimers life with kitty being who he should be with and jean being who he personally wants to be with this draws parallels to that of oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities it can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making sometimes you have no other choiceas a biopic and a christopher nolan film oppenheimer exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields there are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through i guess sometimes all it takes is one brave risktaking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task we need more films like this to inspire thoughtful creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream after all its a tough job

1434,"oppenheimer (i) (2023))","a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws","mrdhwong","oppenheimer is a biographical thriller film written and directed by christopher nolan the dark knight trilogy inception interstellar dunkirk based on the biography american prometheus by kai bird and martin j sherwin starring cillian murphy in the lead role in addition to matt damon robert downey jr emily blunt and florence pugh it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flawsduring the height of the second world war theoretical physicist j robert oppenheimer cillian murphy is recruited by the united states government to oversee the manhattan project a top secret operation intended to develop the worlds first nuclear weapons after becoming acquainted with the projects director major general leslie groves matt damon oppenheimer and the general come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of los alamos new mexico as numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the nazis can devise their own with the war raging and personal troubles mounting oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits but soon suffers the consequences of his dedicationon august th  the atomic bomb little boy was dropped on the japanese city of hiroshima making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war the dropping of this bomb and fat man in nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to world war ii and with it began a frightening new era known as the atomic age to this day it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it the one man whom most people pin all the blame on is j robert oppenheimer whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as the father of the atomic bomb a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life in christopher nolans biopic oppenheimer we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex mans legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades laterin true christopher nolan fashion the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented nonsequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subjects life when we are first introduced to j robert oppenheimer we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers even as a young student however almost immediately after the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him as the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life these scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people this gives the viewer a first person perspective of what oppenheimers mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials its hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion but nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect mananother notable thing about nolans direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes one moment which i wont speak about in too much detail literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last since nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using cgi in his movies he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs by reminding the audience that the nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game as each bomb explodes it can be likened to a ticking clock with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon the creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace something especially necessary considering the films three hour runtime nolan previously exhibited a similar method in s dunkirk which utilised the films score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence once again nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using cg effects to tell a story and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiencyfor what can only be described as the performance of his career cillian murphy brings everything necessary to the role of j robert oppenheimer a man so complex that i cant imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively the combined efforts of both murphys acting and nolans direction help make oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the th century this is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an indepth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish the film paints oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books murphy approaches him like that of a shakespearian figure rife with flaws haughtiness and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate one scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family he can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history while consequently ushering in something even worsethe rest of the films cast all did a fantastic job as well with the standouts being matt damon robert downey jr emily blunt and florence pugh damons take on major general leslie groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use oppenheimers talents to his advantage we watch as groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power grovess ignorance to oppenheimers extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail to that effect he provides an important third party perspective to oppenheimers achievementsits also great to see robert downey jr shine as lewis strauss which is not only his best postmcu role but one of his best roles in general strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing oppenheimers ties to communism he holds such a grudge against oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story downey takes every opportunity to show strausss twofaced nature biding his time for the right moment to strip oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation reportedly downey considers this his best role to date and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performanceemily blunt and florence pugh also contributed significantly as kitty oppenheimer and jean tatlock respectively each of these two women represent something significant in oppenheimers life with kitty being who he should be with and jean being who he personally wants to be with this draws parallels to that of oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities it can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making sometimes you have no other choiceas a biopic and a christopher nolan film oppenheimer exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields there are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through i guess sometimes all it takes is one brave risktaking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task we need more films like this to inspire thoughtful creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream after all its a tough job

his enraged speeches and hateful bellows followed by thundering cheers they show him during his downtime playing with his kids and charming eva braun acting not altogether unpleasant as nauseating as the more wellknown footage of him may be there is something singularly disturbing  even horrifying  about the reminder that yes this monster was in fact humanthe zone of interest in a way does for holocaust films what that haunting clip does for ww footage there are untold movies about this point in history that are horrific to watch yet they are movies we can accept there is a disconnect between us and the ferocious clearly evil nazis this movie though it depicts next to no actual barbarity may go down as the most harrowing of them alllike klondike it is a war film whose horror comes not from images of violence but from the casual way that violence is treated by those at the center of war only this time it is not from the vantage point of traumatized innocents as jeff zhangs review points out this is not the sort of holocaust film that puts the atrocities of nazi germany in the preferred blunt terms its acts of evil  oozing on the periphery of domestic rigamarole  are designed to needle and splinter in the brain rather than suck the air out of the room ashes of the dead in the river as nuisance installing auschwitz ovens like theyre dishwashers gunshots and wails of anguish heard but not seenmore precisely the movie follows a german man as he simply well spends time with his loving family at their lovely home  which as it happens is situated right by the walls of one of the deadliest concentration camps of the third reich whose death and suffering are acknowledged only when they intrude on the familys peace the man is rudolf hss who was the auschwitz commandant  one of the biggest stirs in the family is when he learns he may be promoted possibly forcing them to movein a genre that often forces us to look into hell this movie forces us to remain blind to be clear thats not to say that the truth is hidden were painfully aware of whats being kept from us as were put in the comfort in which people sat and continue to sit while watching genocide from afar and it isnt just the audience that glazer puts into this positionthe actors particularly the leads christian fiedel and sandra hller are eerily convincing and they may have ended up eerily convinced during filming all but forced to immerse themselves in the lives of the hsses they sometimes werent informed where exactly the cameras were located  only that certain rooms in the hss household contained cameras sometimes they didnt even get to hear which ones the actors go about the familys routines presented to us in real time this cachesque cinematography only strengthens the feeling that were sitting somewhere in the house watching hearing what they hear forced to ignore what they ignorebasically this is not akin to such holocaust dramas as schindlers list son of saul or come and see however it isnt quite a film like shoah either  a movie that whereas some would insist that we have a duty to depict nazi violence so that its clear to future generations this mustnt happen again suggests that it cannot be done and so relies solely on the words of survivors letting our minds fill in the rest in the words of david ehlrich the zone of interest splits the difference between the two opposite modes of its solemn genre other reviews view it as a reaction to godard and hanekes statements re schindlers list accusing spielberg of trying to make suffering entertainingthis is indeed a film that sticks in your brain it leaves us horrified not that people like the hsses existed and still exist amongst us but that the movie may simply be a mirror  here we sit in a warm building in comfortable chairs as lives are ended by the day in palestine congo sudan and several others that most of you probably havent even heard of yet there is a world of difference between being uninformed and being an ss officer of course but complicity takes many forms and both types of person are victims of the same propaganda now will you look past the wallby design the movie doesnt have the sort of nightmarish visuals we may expect from glazer yet there are shots of dark hallways and other pitchblack images where the darkness seems as alive and allconsuming as the liquid void from under the skin the music by mica levi during these moments was succinctly described by a youtube commenter as the universe mournfully sighing while i recommend seeing the film in theaters  in a setting where you can truly appreciate the sound design and purposeful imagery  these particular sequences may work even better at homeon certain screens when you stare into pitch

cinematic release even so both films to some extent suffer from too much story overwhelming visualization and a unlynchian frenetic pace the later tv miniseries by the sci fi channel does a better job of telling the story in its entirety but runs about  minutes and does not compare to the original in terms of design lynchs cinematic release by contrast rushes through components of the book and often feels inconsistent in paceplot dune is the story of paul muadib atreides the son of duke leto atreides the just and his bene jesserat concubine lady jessica combining aspects of fantasy scifi and anthropology the story follows young paul through a series of tragedies which find him seeking redemption for an entire galaxy by leading an adoptive tribal culture to a revolutionary cleansing of the malignant imperial system from which he sprung the plot is exceedingly complex  in both lynch versions of the film much is left out of herberts original work subplots abound but true to form lynch avoids shortcuts as much as possible and attempts to show his audience what is going on rather than resorting to a great deal of voiceover narrative in the theatrical release the tv version however attempts to provide even more detail and uses voiceover to patch up the areas glossed over by lynchs scriptsummary if youre a lynch fan and not a big herbert fan or you dont have a great deal of

upperclass atmosphere and has no acquaintances after befriending felix catton a popular and wealthy fellow student however oliver finally seems to find his place at the university invited to the catton family home saltburn for the summer holidays oliver is thrust into the dark heart of the blue bloods nothing is as it seems though as the idyllic vacation transforms into one from hell itselfwritten and directed by emerald fennell saltburn is an initially intriguing though ultimately irritatingly derivative predictable psychological comichorror fennells narrative begins with promise in the first act you arent sure who to trust nor where the story is heading however after the action moves to the manor house saltburn things devolve into a messy and obvious retread of ideas that have been expressed more eloquently in previous films be they the talented mr ripley teorema or the servantthose films examined themes such as class difference obsessiveness personality and manipulation with aplomb and ingenuity fennell appears content to skirt around the edges of these themes never going into them with depth nor are the characters in her narrative provided with any kind of motivation for their actions one in particular acts in a violent vacuum of selfobsession and jealously but why what made this character the way they are fennel never bothers to tell us seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the darkmoreover her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches oliver is essentially just a less charismatic scouse tom ripley with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness felix is exactly like ripleys object of obsession dickie greenleaf while his eccentric family are people weve seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy the ruling class among them familiar and lacking in depth fennells characters arent particularly interesting nor is her narrative particularly original further while her dialogue is frequently funny it can also be pretentious particularly during olivers intermittent narrationthroughout the film fennell handles the material with great deference too much one might argue she lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power the ending featuring fullfrontal nudity reminiscent of the music video to liam gallaghers once starring a thankfully clothed eric cantona seems selfindulgent and shall we say cocky furthermore a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy so completely does it abandon realworld logicconversely linus sandgrens glossy cinematography is striking sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles heightening the suspense of the narrative as well as compounding the decadence of the catton family he employs a ratio of  giving the film a topheavy boxedin look making locations feel daunting it is work full of contrast although a cynical critic might suggest an overreliance on cliched visual metaphors such as reflections or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wingshowever sandgrens visuals generally come as a boon to proceedings as does suzie davies rich production design textured and detailed her work fosters a vivid immersive atmosphere which sophie canales costume design and charlotte dirickxs set decoration compounds in addition anthony williss score is stirring his original pieces are seedy and evocative while songs used throughout perhaps most notably sophie ellisbextors murder on the dancefloor complement the narrativebarry keoghan stars as oliver alongside jacob elordi as felix alison oliver as felixs sister venetia and rosamund pike as felixs mother elspeth keoghan is a fascinating actor who plays strange characters with verve and intelligence here however he gives an inconsistent performance when playing oliver as a weird insular personality he shines though when he has to display his dominant side keoghan lacks conviction and doesnt convince an oddly played oddly written nighttime scene with venetia being clearest evidence of thiselordi does much more assured work despite the fact that the character is just a  version of the aforementioned greenleaf he impresses though overcoming the scant characterisation of the role oliver is excellent underplaying the complexities of her character while pike steals the show as the eccentric elspeth richard e grant also stars as felixs father but is criminally underutilised while archie madekwes grating performance as felixs cousin is smug and onenotein conclusion emerald fennells saltburn is a film trying to provoke though isnt as challenging nor original as its creator thinks it is though it is funny from time to time and the first act is intriguing and suspenseful the film is ultimately an uneven predictable and derivative affair while the cinematography is striking and the score atmospheric the performance of star barry keoghan is inconsistent although rosamund pike is a delight the film around her is not worthy of her talents nor can she save it completely not to rub salt in the wound but this film doesnt burn as brightly as it could have","24 november 2023","5/10",2023-11-24,NA

shocked to see that the major problem they had in aquaman  was again manifested in this sequel if you watch a film you know the kind of tone and feel that a movie is giving you but this movie feels like a jumbled medley of imitations from different kinds of films almost like a parody theres a minute scene where you felt like this is from an indiana jones world and then the next thing you know youre stuck in the realm of journey  the mysterious island we can name a lot of different movies that this film takes its tone and design and pastes it into the movie war of the worlds the matrix revolutions ridley scotts aliens and okay well stop now the result is an endless patchwork of downgraded recreations from various movies it felt like aquaman had a day at disneyland going into different kind of moviethemed rides minus the funadding to that the first act felt like it was venturing into a documentary style format mixed with ridley scotts alien style of exposition alien was a masterpiece but like we said this is a dumpster reiteration it was slow it had little to no suspense it tried to build momentum but it didnt work they could have cut  minutes but they didnt it was unnecessarily drawn out as they spent time showing the entirety of their journey into the deep unknown like this is some kind of art house filmnow a lot are asking is amber heard in it well yes did she have many scenes her presence was only about  of the whole film her character mera did play a pivotal role for the story but james wan the director knew when to show her on screen the question is her presence important on screen seems like what james wan would ask himself before making the decision to put her in she only had few dialogues but her performance was still flatwe also have a problem with how much they made use of space especially in the first act we saw theyre a lot of wide shots used but the issue here is the space that filled in those shots the surroundings locations orand environments were only there because they were made to be there it barely did anything to the story but when it comes to scenes that were crowded or had various props or extras the cameras ddint give audience the time to breathe and process the visuals a lot of mid to fast cuts there wasnt much of a sense of appreciation to enjoy the visuals they have built in the end we felt discontentedfirst aquaman at least had villains that were enjoyable to watch this time the villain or again villains were just forgettable the motivations were weak the main villain didnt really drive the story forward it had a backstory and conflict that were created merely for the purpose of this movies existence we couldnt care less because its nowhere interesting let alone enjoyableand talking about that final battle oh man it was unbearable to the point that it turned laughable was it because of the reshoots that they suffered here the whole movie led to the final battle it was a journey between aquaman and his brother only for us to find out that the villain was feeble and it gave the benefit of the plot armor for aquaman and his weapon its just bad storytelling on top of bad execution overalland the movie draggggggsssssss so much we even questioned what happened to james wan from the beginning up until the climax we were just waiting for something cool or unique to happen but it didnt it drags until the final battle where it should be longer but then thats when they decided to just cut things off and ended it abruptly the moment the exciting thing was about to pop up were confusedamidst these flaws one thing that truly stood out is its message on brotherhood a beautiful message combo with good pairing jason momoa and patrick wilson have commendable chemistry we can see it from the way they talk to each other theres certainly some dedication they put into establishing their relationship its nothing that you can remember for years but its enough to at least carry this movie despite the many bad outcomes this movie turned out to beultimately aquaman  seems tailored for a younger audience who just want to enjoy monsters and sea creatures fighting against literally anything or anyone rather than catering to teenagers or adults seeking a compelling narrativeverdict similar to its predecessor this sequel fails to find its identity drowning in an ocean of borrowed tones and styles from previous movies with a shallow story forgettable villains and inconsistent pacing this film struggles to stay afloat while its a tidal wave of disappointing results the portrayal of brotherhood between the two leads stands out as a beacon carrying the entire movie overall this final chapter from the dceu serves as a testament were in dire need for a total reboot of these superheroes","22 december 2023","5/10",2023-12-22,NA

her presence important on screen seems like what james wan would ask himself before making the decision to put her in she only had few dialogues but her performance was still flatwe also have a problem with how much they made use of space especially in the first act we saw theyre a lot of wide shots used but the issue here is the space that filled in those shots the surroundings locations

scorsese based on the nonfiction book of the same name by david grann starring leonardo dicaprio robert de niro and lily gladstone it touches upon an often overlooked piece of american history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and castin the early s the discovery of oil on land belonging to the native american osage nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world this sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the osage tribe as possible among this group of interlopers is ernest burkhart leonardo dicaprio whom upon arriving in oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle william king hale robert de niro to marry a member of the osage as a way of inheriting their fortune ernest soon falls in love with and later marries mollie lily gladstone a young osage woman who has strong ties to her familys riches as the white occupation of native land continues members of the osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances with some of mollies close family being among the most prominent victimsone of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment they also function as a great method of preservation no matter obscure the topic may be if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream then it has already been permanently preserved in some way this is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time and in doing so has helped maintain its relevance with the general public one event that is often glanced over is the osage indian murders a series of slayings of wealthy members of the native american osage tribe during the early th century however thanks to martin scorseses film killers of the flower moon audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated eyeopening look at americas treatment of one particular group of their indigenous populationmuch like most of scorseses best known work the film is framed as an epic indepth study of the dark side of human nature we watch how the osage tribe who live in harmony among themselves are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land in spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated the osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs because of this the tribes happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination first verbal and then physical it is here we see the sinister plan of william king hale come into play where he marries off his nephew ernest into the osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right what makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it only a filmmaker like scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity and in a style that remains as timeless as everadditionally almost all of scorseses visual trademarks as a director are on full display here from his wideopen cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of s america to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene one in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between ernest and william as they discuss business regarding the osage we see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe with ernest choosing to remain loyal to his osage wife mollie while his uncle william reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place here scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room the darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the osage have created up until this pointdue to the scale of its theme and plotting the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours  minutes in total this is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience while i personally think this made the film more interesting to watch im not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers the films pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air which i believe works rather effectively and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion in other words this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues to that effect scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other hollywood blockbustersin his sixth collaboration with the legendary director leonardo dicaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of ernest burkhart what makes dicaprios character so intriguing is his indecisive nature in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his osage wife mollie on one hand ernests loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncles idea in the first place while on the other hand when he truly falls for mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe dicaprio displays his signature range of emotion here alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncles bidding both of which he pulls off quite effectivelyafter working on ten films together robert de niro steps back from his usual spot as the scorsese lead and into the supporting role as william king hale where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it his intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain with little regard for the wellbeing of others even his nephew what i consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the bible says about spreading the word of god his claim that god wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film a role like this is perfect for an actor like robert de niro and what better director to show this to the world than martin scorsesehowever the films true standout would have to be lily gladstone as mollie who is truly the heart and soul of this story here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life whether its her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives yet despite all these hardships mollie remains as steadfast as ever choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds and she is among the last of her family who hasnt completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle this is easily a career defining role for gladstone and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one dayfor the american history buff and the martin scorsese fan killers of the flower moon represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds it brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another wellcrafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veterans library as mentioned previously it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period after all as the classic saying goes  those who dont learn from history are doomed to repeat iti rate it a solid ","21 october 2023","5/10",2023-10-21,NA

runtimes epics like lawrence of arabia or das boot are both over three hours in length and rocket along at a brisk pace largely because of fastidious editing the duration of both those pictures is necessary one could argue to tell their stories without sacrificing details coherence or excitement then there are films like heavens gate which also has a runtime of over three hours and is a bloated selfindulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director michael ciminos arrogant refusal to cut anythingmartin scorseses killers of the flower moon teeters somewhere between both camps it has elements deserving of high praise but is inarguably too long with pacing structural and narrative issues galore based on the nonfiction novel of the same name by david grann the film centers on emmet burkhart a simpleminded world war i veteran who returns to the osage nation to the home of his uncle william king hale there emmet falls for an osage named mollie who his uncle tells him is set to inherit much of her peoples oil headrights meanwhile someone is killing off the wealthy osage in the area and it looks like mollies family might be nexton paper it sounds like a fascinating exciting picture with dashes of psychological intrigue however scorseses version of the tale is dour swollen and predictable granns riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed lacking any kind of suspense or momentum screenwriters scorsese and eric roth cram too much into the narrative namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa they have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly which they dont do preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play outhad scorsese and longtime collaborator thelma schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth things could have been different there are some brilliant sequences in the movie in fact the first third is engaging and intriguing the mystery is successfully set up the location established and the characters introduced then things start going downhill the pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime until the end of course when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion beyond pacing there are some fundamental flaws editingwise that are inexplicable considering scorsese and schoonmakers prestigefor example seemingly important characters are introduced then disappear for long stretches of time similarly the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times or overlooked leaving us in the dark furthermore at times cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak all this including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative is amateur work far below scorsese and schoonmakers levelthis is not to say however that killers of the flower moon is without redeeming elements to make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation no matter its effectiveness scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the osage people the film doesnt explore the historical or cultural context of the osage nation nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivorsscorsese and roths narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the osage or the systemic injustice that they face their characterisation lacks depth or nuance relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes had he focused on the perspective and agency of the osage rather than the corrupt inept white characters scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his handsconversely rodrigo prietos cinematography is evocative and enchanting it makes for a stunning watch proving scorseses eye for visuals has not been blinded under scorseses direction prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the oklahoma landscape astutely while jack fisks detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness which adam williss set decoration and jacqueline wests costume design only compoundsmoreover the late great robbie robertsons score is striking bearing a resemblance to the work of ry cooder full of sleazy slide guitars and indian chants it complements the narrative perfectly the inclusion of periodaccurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism which in the times of baz luhrmann who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces is most welcome the last project robertson worked on before his death his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansongleonardo dicaprio stars as emmet alongside lily gladstone as mollie and robert deniro as king hale dicaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances but here takes a page out of the daniel day lewis playbook the most intense acting must surely be the best dicaprio spends the whole film frowning scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his characters expressions and eccentricities in the first third he has a bit of range though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performanceas does lily gladstone initially she creates in mollie a nuanced and witty character who can see through people she doesnt suffer fools and we find her both compelling and captivating however after the first third of the film she becomes subservient unquestioning and dull and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being shall we say slowed down deniro for his part plays king hale like an evil george burns manipulative darkly funny and morally bereft anytime hes on screen the film is a joy hes the best thing about itthey are supported by a large cast of talented actors some of whom do great work ty mitchell is excellent as john a poor man drawn into emmet and king hales plans who has more dignity then the both of them combined jesse plemons does typically fine work as fbi man tom white while louis cancelmi is seedily slick as kelsie morrison a stooge of king hales on the other hand the likes of cara jade myers as mollies alcoholic sister and brendan fraser in a thankfully small role as king hales lawyer are both so miscast and over the top they distract from everything going on around themits a sad indictment of a film when its central message was summed up more succinctly in a dean martin song the money song from  them that have it get more of it the less they need it the more they love it such is the thesis of the film greed spreads like a plague and the richer you are the greedier you are its not original nor is it profound this very same tale was told much more impactfully back in

scorsese based on the nonfiction book of the same name by david grann starring leonardo dicaprio robert de niro and lily gladstone it touches upon an often overlooked piece of american history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and castin the early s the discovery of oil on land belonging to the native american osage nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world this sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the osage tribe as possible among this group of interlopers is ernest burkhart leonardo dicaprio whom upon arriving in oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle william king hale robert de niro to marry a member of the osage as a way of inheriting their fortune ernest soon falls in love with and later marries mollie lily gladstone a young osage woman who has strong ties to her familys riches as the white occupation of native land continues members of the osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances with some of mollies close family being among the most prominent victimsone of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment they also function as a great method of preservation no matter obscure the topic may be if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream then it has already been permanently preserved in some way this is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time and in doing so has helped maintain its relevance with the general public one event that is often glanced over is the osage indian murders a series of slayings of wealthy members of the native american osage tribe during the early th century however thanks to martin scorseses film killers of the flower moon audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated eyeopening look at americas treatment of one particular group of their indigenous populationmuch like most of scorseses best known work the film is framed as an epic indepth study of the dark side of human nature we watch how the osage tribe who live in harmony among themselves are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land in spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated the osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs because of this the tribes happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination first verbal and then physical it is here we see the sinister plan of william king hale come into play where he marries off his nephew ernest into the osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right what makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it only a filmmaker like scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity and in a style that remains as timeless as everadditionally almost all of scorseses visual trademarks as a director are on full display here from his wideopen cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of s america to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene one in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between ernest and william as they discuss business regarding the osage we see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe with ernest choosing to remain loyal to his osage wife mollie while his uncle william reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place here scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room the darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the osage have created up until this pointdue to the scale of its theme and plotting the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours  minutes in total this is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience while i personally think this made the film more interesting to watch im not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers the films pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air which i believe works rather effectively and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion in other words this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues to that effect scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other hollywood blockbustersin his sixth collaboration with the legendary director leonardo dicaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of ernest burkhart what makes dicaprios character so intriguing is his indecisive nature in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his osage wife mollie on one hand ernests loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncles idea in the first place while on the other hand when he truly falls for mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe dicaprio displays his signature range of emotion here alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncles bidding both of which he pulls off quite effectivelyafter working on ten films together robert de niro steps back from his usual spot as the scorsese lead and into the supporting role as william king hale where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it his intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain with little regard for the wellbeing of others even his nephew what i consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the bible says about spreading the word of god his claim that god wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film a role like this is perfect for an actor like robert de niro and what better director to show this to the world than martin scorsesehowever the films true standout would have to be lily gladstone as mollie who is truly the heart and soul of this story here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life whether its her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives yet despite all these hardships mollie remains as steadfast as ever choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds and she is among the last of her family who hasnt completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle this is easily a career defining role for gladstone and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one dayfor the american history buff and the martin scorsese fan killers of the flower moon represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds it brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another wellcrafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veterans library as mentioned previously it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period after all as the classic saying goes  those who dont learn from history are doomed to repeat iti rate it a solid ","21 october 2023","5/10",2023-10-21,NA

runtimes epics like lawrence of arabia or das boot are both over three hours in length and rocket along at a brisk pace largely because of fastidious editing the duration of both those pictures is necessary one could argue to tell their stories without sacrificing details coherence or excitement then there are films like heavens gate which also has a runtime of over three hours and is a bloated selfindulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director michael ciminos arrogant refusal to cut anythingmartin scorseses killers of the flower moon teeters somewhere between both camps it has elements deserving of high praise but is inarguably too long with pacing structural and narrative issues galore based on the nonfiction novel of the same name by david grann the film centers on emmet burkhart a simpleminded world war i veteran who returns to the osage nation to the home of his uncle william king hale there emmet falls for an osage named mollie who his uncle tells him is set to inherit much of her peoples oil headrights meanwhile someone is killing off the wealthy osage in the area and it looks like mollies family might be nexton paper it sounds like a fascinating exciting picture with dashes of psychological intrigue however scorseses version of the tale is dour swollen and predictable granns riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed lacking any kind of suspense or momentum screenwriters scorsese and eric roth cram too much into the narrative namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa they have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly which they dont do preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play outhad scorsese and longtime collaborator thelma schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth things could have been different there are some brilliant sequences in the movie in fact the first third is engaging and intriguing the mystery is successfully set up the location established and the characters introduced then things start going downhill the pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime until the end of course when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion beyond pacing there are some fundamental flaws editingwise that are inexplicable considering scorsese and schoonmakers prestigefor example seemingly important characters are introduced then disappear for long stretches of time similarly the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times or overlooked leaving us in the dark furthermore at times cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak all this including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative is amateur work far below scorsese and schoonmakers levelthis is not to say however that killers of the flower moon is without redeeming elements to make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation no matter its effectiveness scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the osage people the film doesnt explore the historical or cultural context of the osage nation nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivorsscorsese and roths narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the osage or the systemic injustice that they face their characterisation lacks depth or nuance relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes had he focused on the perspective and agency of the osage rather than the corrupt inept white characters scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his handsconversely rodrigo prietos cinematography is evocative and enchanting it makes for a stunning watch proving scorseses eye for visuals has not been blinded under scorseses direction prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the oklahoma landscape astutely while jack fisks detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness which adam williss set decoration and jacqueline wests costume design only compoundsmoreover the late great robbie robertsons score is striking bearing a resemblance to the work of ry cooder full of sleazy slide guitars and indian chants it complements the narrative perfectly the inclusion of periodaccurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism which in the times of baz luhrmann who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces is most welcome the last project robertson worked on before his death his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansongleonardo dicaprio stars as emmet alongside lily gladstone as mollie and robert deniro as king hale dicaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances but here takes a page out of the daniel day lewis playbook the most intense acting must surely be the best dicaprio spends the whole film frowning scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his characters expressions and eccentricities in the first third he has a bit of range though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performanceas does lily gladstone initially she creates in mollie a nuanced and witty character who can see through people she doesnt suffer fools and we find her both compelling and captivating however after the first third of the film she becomes subservient unquestioning and dull and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being shall we say slowed down deniro for his part plays king hale like an evil george burns manipulative darkly funny and morally bereft anytime hes on screen the film is a joy hes the best thing about itthey are supported by a large cast of talented actors some of whom do great work ty mitchell is excellent as john a poor man drawn into emmet and king hales plans who has more dignity then the both of them combined jesse plemons does typically fine work as fbi man tom white while louis cancelmi is seedily slick as kelsie morrison a stooge of king hales on the other hand the likes of cara jade myers as mollies alcoholic sister and brendan fraser in a thankfully small role as king hales lawyer are both so miscast and over the top they distract from everything going on around themits a

scorsese based on the nonfiction book of the same name by david grann starring leonardo dicaprio robert de niro and lily gladstone it touches upon an often overlooked piece of american history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and castin the early s the discovery of oil on land belonging to the native american osage nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world this sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the osage tribe as possible among this group of interlopers is ernest burkhart leonardo dicaprio whom upon arriving in oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle william king hale robert de niro to marry a member of the osage as a way of inheriting their fortune ernest soon falls in love with and later marries mollie lily gladstone a young osage woman who has strong ties to her familys riches as the white occupation of native land continues members of the osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances with some of mollies close family being among the most prominent victimsone of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment they also function as a great method of preservation no matter obscure the topic may be if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream then it has already been permanently preserved in some way this is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time and in doing so has helped maintain its relevance with the general public one event that is often glanced over is the osage indian murders a series of slayings of wealthy members of the native american osage tribe during the early th century however thanks to martin scorseses film killers of the flower moon audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated eyeopening look at americas treatment of one particular group of their indigenous populationmuch like most of scorseses best known work the film is framed as an epic indepth study of the dark side of human nature we watch how the osage tribe who live in harmony among themselves are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land in spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated the osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs because of this the tribes happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination first verbal and then physical it is here we see the sinister plan of william king hale come into play where he marries off his nephew ernest into the osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right what makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it only a filmmaker like scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity and in a style that remains as timeless as everadditionally almost all of scorseses visual trademarks as a director are on full display here from his wideopen cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of s america to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene one in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between ernest and william as they discuss business regarding the osage we see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe with ernest choosing to remain loyal to his osage wife mollie while his uncle william reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place here scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room the darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the osage have created up until this pointdue to the scale of its theme and plotting the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours  minutes in total this is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience while i personally think this made the film more interesting to watch im not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers the films pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air which i believe works rather effectively and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion in other words this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues to that effect scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other hollywood blockbustersin his sixth collaboration with the legendary director leonardo dicaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of ernest burkhart what makes dicaprios character so intriguing is his indecisive nature in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his osage wife mollie on one hand ernests loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncles idea in the first place while on the other hand when he truly falls for mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe dicaprio displays his signature range of emotion here alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncles bidding both of which he pulls off quite effectivelyafter working on ten films together robert de niro steps back from his usual spot as the scorsese lead and into the supporting role as william king hale where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it his intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain with little regard for the wellbeing of others even his nephew what i consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the bible says about spreading the word of god his claim that god wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film a role like this is perfect for an actor like robert de niro and what better director to show this to the world than martin scorsesehowever the films true standout would have to be lily gladstone as mollie who is truly the heart and soul of this story here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life whether its her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives yet despite all these hardships mollie remains as steadfast as ever choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds and she is among the last of her family who hasnt completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle this is easily a career defining role for gladstone and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one dayfor the american history buff and the martin scorsese fan killers of the flower moon represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds it brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another wellcrafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veterans library as mentioned previously it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period after all as the classic saying goes  those who dont learn from history are doomed to repeat iti rate it a solid ","21 october 2023","5/10",2023-10-21,NA

runtimes epics like lawrence of arabia or das boot are both over three hours in length and rocket along at a brisk pace largely because of fastidious editing the duration of both those pictures is necessary one could argue to tell their stories without sacrificing details coherence or excitement then there are films like heavens gate which also has a runtime of over three hours and is a bloated selfindulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director michael ciminos arrogant refusal to cut anythingmartin scorseses killers of the flower moon teeters somewhere between both camps it has elements deserving of high praise but is inarguably too long with pacing structural and narrative issues galore based on the nonfiction novel of the same name by david grann the film centers on emmet burkhart a simpleminded world war i veteran who returns to the osage nation to the home of his uncle william king hale there emmet falls for an osage named mollie who his uncle tells him is set to inherit much of her peoples oil headrights meanwhile someone is killing off the wealthy osage in the area and it looks like mollies family might be nexton paper it sounds like a fascinating exciting picture with dashes of psychological intrigue however scorseses version of the tale is dour swollen and predictable granns riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed lacking any kind of suspense or momentum screenwriters scorsese and eric roth cram too much into the narrative namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa they have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly which they dont do preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play outhad scorsese and longtime collaborator thelma schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth things could have been different there are some brilliant sequences in the movie in fact the first third is engaging and intriguing the mystery is successfully set up the location established and the characters introduced then things start going downhill the pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime until the end of course when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion beyond pacing there are some fundamental flaws editingwise that are inexplicable considering scorsese and schoonmakers prestigefor example seemingly important characters are introduced then disappear for long stretches of time similarly the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times or overlooked leaving us in the dark furthermore at times cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak all this including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative is amateur work far below scorsese and schoonmakers levelthis is not to say however that killers of the flower moon is without redeeming elements to make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation no matter its effectiveness scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the osage people the film doesnt explore the historical or cultural context of the osage nation nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivorsscorsese and roths narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the osage or the systemic injustice that they face their characterisation lacks depth or nuance relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes had he focused on the perspective and agency of the osage rather than the corrupt inept white characters scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his handsconversely rodrigo prietos cinematography is evocative and enchanting it makes for a stunning watch proving scorseses eye for visuals has not been blinded under scorseses direction prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the oklahoma landscape astutely while jack fisks detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness which adam williss set decoration and jacqueline wests costume design only compoundsmoreover the late great robbie robertsons score is striking bearing a resemblance to the work of ry cooder full of sleazy slide guitars and indian chants it complements the narrative perfectly the inclusion of periodaccurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism which in the times of baz luhrmann who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces is most welcome the last project robertson worked on before his death his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansongleonardo dicaprio stars as emmet alongside lily gladstone as mollie and robert deniro as king hale dicaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances but here takes a page out of the daniel day lewis playbook the most intense acting must surely be the best dicaprio spends the whole film frowning scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his characters expressions and eccentricities in the first third he has a bit of range though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performanceas does lily gladstone initially she creates in mollie a nuanced and witty character who can see through people she doesnt suffer fools and we find her both compelling and captivating however after the first third of the film she becomes subservient unquestioning and dull and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being shall we say slowed down deniro for his part plays king hale like an evil george burns manipulative darkly funny and morally bereft anytime hes on screen the film is a joy hes the best thing about itthey are supported by a large cast of talented actors some of whom do great work ty mitchell is excellent as john a poor man drawn into emmet and king hales plans who has more dignity then the both of them combined jesse plemons does typically fine work as fbi man tom white while louis cancelmi is seedily slick as kelsie morrison a stooge of king hales on the other hand the likes of cara jade myers as mollies alcoholic sister and brendan fraser in a thankfully small role as king hales lawyer are both so miscast and over the top they distract from everything going on around themits a sad indictment of a film when its central message was summed up more succinctly in a dean martin song the money song from  them that have it get more of it the less they need it the more they love it such is the thesis of the film greed spreads like a plague and the richer you are the greedier you are its not original nor is it profound this very same tale was told much more impactfully back in  in mervyn leroys the fbi storyat the end of the day killers of the flower moon is a truncated adaptation of a great nonfiction book overlong and devoid of any original or meaningful message despite

scorsese based on the nonfiction book of the same name by david grann starring leonardo dicaprio robert de niro and lily gladstone it touches upon an often overlooked piece of american history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and castin the early s the discovery of oil on land belonging to the native american osage nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world this sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the osage tribe as possible among this group of interlopers is ernest burkhart leonardo dicaprio whom upon arriving in oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle william king hale robert de niro to marry a member of the osage as a way of inheriting their fortune ernest soon falls in love with and later marries mollie lily gladstone a young osage woman who has strong ties to her familys riches as the white occupation of native land continues members of the osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances with some of mollies close family being among the most prominent victimsone of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment they also function as a great method of preservation no matter obscure the topic may be if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream then it has already been permanently preserved in some way this is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time and in doing so has helped maintain its relevance with the general public one event that is often glanced over is the osage indian murders a series of slayings of wealthy members of the native american osage tribe during the early th century however thanks to martin scorseses film killers of the flower moon audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated eyeopening look at americas treatment of one particular group of their indigenous populationmuch like most of scorseses best known work the film is framed as an epic indepth study of the dark side of human nature we watch how the osage tribe who live in harmony among themselves are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land in spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated the osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs because of this the tribes happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination first verbal and then physical it is here we see the sinister plan of william king hale come into play where he marries off his nephew ernest into the osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right what makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it only a filmmaker like scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity and in a style that remains as timeless as everadditionally almost all of scorseses visual trademarks as a director are on full display here from his wideopen cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of s america to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene one in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between ernest and william as they discuss business regarding the osage we see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe with ernest choosing to remain loyal to his osage wife mollie while his uncle william reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place here scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room the darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the osage have created up until this pointdue to the scale of its theme and plotting the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours  minutes in total this is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience while i personally think this made the film more interesting to watch im not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers the films pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air which i believe works rather effectively and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion in other words this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues to that effect scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other hollywood blockbustersin his sixth collaboration with the legendary director leonardo dicaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of ernest burkhart what makes dicaprios character so intriguing is his indecisive nature in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his osage wife mollie on one hand ernests loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncles idea in the first place while on the other hand when he truly falls for mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe dicaprio displays his signature range of emotion here alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncles bidding both of which he pulls off quite effectivelyafter working on ten films together robert de niro steps back from his usual spot as the scorsese lead and into the supporting role as william king hale where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it his intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain with little regard for the wellbeing of others even his nephew what i consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the bible says about spreading the word of god his claim that god wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film a role like this is perfect for an actor like robert de niro and what better director to show this to the world than martin scorsesehowever the films true standout would have to be lily gladstone as mollie who is truly the heart and soul of this story here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life whether its her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives yet despite all these hardships mollie remains as steadfast as ever choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds and she is among the last of her family who hasnt completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle this is easily a career defining role for gladstone and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one dayfor the american history buff and the martin scorsese fan killers of the flower moon represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds it brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another wellcrafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veterans library as mentioned previously it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period after all as the classic saying goes  those who dont learn from history are doomed to repeat iti rate it a solid ","21 october 2023","5/10",2023-10-21,NA

runtimes epics like lawrence of arabia or das boot are both over three hours in length and rocket along at a brisk pace largely because of fastidious editing the duration of both those pictures is necessary one could argue to tell their stories without sacrificing details coherence or excitement then there are films like heavens gate which also has a runtime of over three hours and is a bloated selfindulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director michael ciminos arrogant refusal to cut anythingmartin scorseses killers of the flower moon teeters somewhere between both camps it has elements deserving of high praise but is inarguably too long with pacing structural and narrative issues galore based on the nonfiction novel of the same name by david grann the film centers on emmet burkhart a simpleminded world war i veteran who returns to the osage nation to the home of his uncle william king hale there emmet falls for an osage named mollie who his uncle tells him is set to inherit much of her peoples oil headrights meanwhile someone is killing off the wealthy osage in the area and it looks like mollies family might be nexton paper it sounds like a fascinating exciting picture with dashes of psychological intrigue however scorseses version of the tale is dour swollen and predictable granns riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed lacking any kind of suspense or momentum screenwriters scorsese and eric roth cram too much into the narrative namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa they have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly which they dont do preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play outhad scorsese and longtime collaborator thelma schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth things could have been different there are some brilliant sequences in the movie in fact the first third is engaging and intriguing the mystery is successfully set up the location established and the characters introduced then things start going downhill the pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime until the end of course when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion beyond pacing there are some fundamental flaws editingwise that are inexplicable considering scorsese and schoonmakers prestigefor example seemingly important characters are introduced then disappear for long stretches of time similarly the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times or overlooked leaving us in the dark furthermore at times cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak all this including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative is amateur work far below scorsese and schoonmakers levelthis is not to say however that killers of the flower moon is without redeeming elements to make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation no matter its effectiveness scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the osage people the film doesnt explore the historical or cultural context of the osage nation nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivorsscorsese and roths narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the osage or the systemic injustice that they face their characterisation lacks depth or nuance relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes had he focused on the perspective and agency of the osage rather than the corrupt inept white characters scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his handsconversely rodrigo prietos cinematography is evocative and enchanting it makes for a stunning watch proving scorseses eye for visuals has not been blinded under scorseses direction prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the oklahoma landscape astutely while jack fisks detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness which adam williss set decoration and jacqueline wests costume design only compoundsmoreover the late great robbie robertsons score is striking bearing a resemblance to the work of ry cooder full of sleazy slide guitars and indian chants it complements the narrative perfectly the inclusion of periodaccurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism which in the times of baz luhrmann who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces is most welcome the last project robertson worked on before his death his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansongleonardo dicaprio stars as emmet alongside lily gladstone as mollie and robert deniro as king hale dicaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances but here takes a page out of the daniel day lewis playbook the most intense acting must surely be the best dicaprio spends the whole film frowning scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his characters expressions and eccentricities in the first third he has a bit of range though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performanceas does lily gladstone initially she creates in mollie a nuanced and witty character who can see through people she doesnt suffer fools and we find her both compelling and captivating however after the first third of the film she becomes subservient unquestioning and dull and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being shall we say slowed down deniro for his part plays king hale like an evil george burns manipulative darkly funny and morally bereft anytime hes on screen the film is a joy hes the best thing about itthey are supported by a large cast of talented actors some of whom do great work ty mitchell is excellent as john a poor man drawn into emmet and king hales plans who has more dignity then the both of them combined jesse plemons does typically fine work as fbi man tom white while louis cancelmi is seedily slick as kelsie morrison a stooge of king hales on the other hand the likes of cara jade myers as mollies alcoholic sister and brendan fraser in a thankfully small role as king hales lawyer are both so miscast and over the top they distract from everything going on around themits a sad indictment of a film when its central message was summed up more succinctly in a dean martin song the money song from  them that have it get more of it the less they need it the more they love it such is the thesis of the film greed spreads like a plague and the richer you are the greedier you are its not original nor is it profound this very same tale was told much more impactfully back in  in mervyn leroys the fbi storyat the end of the day killers of the flower moon is a truncated adaptation of a great nonfiction book overlong and devoid of any original or meaningful message despite

scorsese based on the nonfiction book of the same name by david grann starring leonardo dicaprio robert de niro and lily gladstone it touches upon an often overlooked piece of american history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and castin the early s the discovery of oil on land belonging to the native american osage nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world this sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the osage tribe as possible among this group of interlopers is ernest burkhart leonardo dicaprio whom upon arriving in oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle william king hale robert de niro to marry a member of the osage as a way of inheriting their fortune ernest soon falls in love with and later marries mollie lily gladstone a young osage woman who has strong ties to her familys riches as the white occupation of native land continues members of the osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances with some of mollies close family being among the most prominent victimsone of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment they also function as a great method of preservation no matter obscure the topic may be if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream then it has already been permanently preserved in some way this is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time and in doing so has helped maintain its relevance with the general public one event that is often glanced over is the osage indian murders a series of slayings of wealthy members of the native american osage tribe during the early th century however thanks to martin scorseses film killers of the flower moon audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated eyeopening look at americas treatment of one particular group of their indigenous populationmuch like most of scorseses best known work the film is framed as an epic indepth study of the dark side of human nature we watch how the osage tribe who live in harmony among themselves are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land in spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated the osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs because of this the tribes happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination first verbal and then physical it is here we see the sinister plan of william king hale come into play where he marries off his nephew ernest into the osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right what makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it only a filmmaker like scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity and in a style that remains as timeless as everadditionally almost all of scorseses visual trademarks as a director are on full display here from his wideopen cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of s america to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene one in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between ernest and william as they discuss business regarding the osage we see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe with ernest choosing to remain loyal to his osage wife mollie while his uncle william reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place here scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room the darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the osage have created up until this pointdue to the scale of its theme and plotting the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours  minutes in total this is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience while i personally think this made the film more interesting to watch im not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers the films pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air which i believe works rather effectively and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion in other words this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues to that effect scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other hollywood blockbustersin his sixth collaboration with the legendary director leonardo dicaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of ernest burkhart what makes dicaprios character so intriguing is his indecisive nature in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his osage wife mollie on one hand ernests loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncles idea in the first place while on the other hand when he truly falls for mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe dicaprio displays his signature range of emotion here alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncles bidding both of which he pulls off quite effectivelyafter working on ten films together robert de niro steps back from his usual spot as the scorsese lead and into the supporting role as william king hale where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it his intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain with little regard for the wellbeing of others even his nephew what i consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the bible says about spreading the word of god his claim that god wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film a role like this is perfect for an actor like robert de niro and what better director to show this to the world than martin scorsesehowever the films true standout would have to be lily gladstone as mollie who is truly the heart and soul of this story here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life whether its her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives yet despite all these hardships mollie remains as steadfast as ever choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds and she is among the last of her family who hasnt completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle this is easily a career defining role for gladstone and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one dayfor the american history buff and the martin scorsese fan killers of the flower moon represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds it brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another wellcrafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veterans library as mentioned previously it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period after all as the classic saying goes  those who dont learn from history are doomed to repeat iti rate it a solid ","21 october 2023","5/10",2023-10-21,NA

runtimes epics like lawrence of arabia or das boot are both over three hours in length and rocket along at a brisk pace largely because of fastidious editing the duration of both those pictures is necessary one could argue to tell their stories without sacrificing details coherence or excitement then there are films like heavens gate which also has a runtime of over three hours and is a bloated selfindulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director michael ciminos arrogant refusal to cut anythingmartin scorseses killers of the flower moon teeters somewhere between both camps it has elements deserving of high praise but is inarguably too long with pacing structural and narrative issues galore based on the nonfiction novel of the same name by david grann the film centers on emmet burkhart a simpleminded world war i veteran who returns to the osage nation to the home of his uncle william king hale there emmet falls for an osage named mollie who his uncle tells him is set to inherit much of her peoples oil headrights meanwhile someone is killing off the wealthy osage in the area and it looks like mollies family might be nexton paper it sounds like a fascinating exciting picture with dashes of psychological intrigue however scorseses version of the tale is dour swollen and predictable granns riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed lacking any kind of suspense or momentum screenwriters scorsese and eric roth cram too much into the narrative namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa they have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly which they dont do preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play outhad scorsese and longtime collaborator thelma schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth things could have been different there are some brilliant sequences in the movie in fact the first third is engaging and intriguing the mystery is successfully set up the location established and the characters introduced then things start going downhill the pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime until the end of course when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion beyond pacing there are some fundamental flaws editingwise that are inexplicable considering scorsese and schoonmakers prestigefor example seemingly important characters are introduced then disappear for long stretches of time similarly the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times or overlooked leaving us in the dark furthermore at times cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak all this including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative is amateur work far below scorsese and schoonmakers levelthis is not to say however that killers of the flower moon is without redeeming elements to make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation no matter its effectiveness scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the osage people the film doesnt explore the historical or cultural context of the osage nation nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivorsscorsese and roths narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the osage or the systemic injustice that they face their characterisation lacks depth or nuance relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes had he focused on the perspective and agency of the osage rather than the corrupt inept white characters scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his handsconversely rodrigo prietos cinematography is evocative and enchanting it makes for a stunning watch proving scorseses eye for visuals has not been blinded under scorseses direction prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the oklahoma landscape astutely while jack fisks detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness which adam williss set decoration and jacqueline wests costume design only compoundsmoreover the late great robbie robertsons score is striking bearing a resemblance to the work of ry cooder full of sleazy slide guitars and indian chants it complements the narrative perfectly the inclusion of periodaccurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism which in the times of baz luhrmann who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces is most welcome the last project robertson worked on before his death his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansongleonardo dicaprio stars as emmet alongside lily gladstone as mollie and robert deniro as king hale dicaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances but here takes a page out of the daniel day lewis playbook the most intense acting must surely be the best dicaprio spends the whole film frowning scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his characters expressions and eccentricities in the first third he has a bit of range though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performanceas does lily gladstone initially she creates in mollie a nuanced and witty character who can see through people she doesnt suffer fools and we find her both compelling and captivating however after the first third of the film she becomes subservient unquestioning and dull and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being shall we say slowed down deniro for his part plays king hale like an evil george burns manipulative darkly funny and morally bereft anytime hes on screen the film is a joy hes the best thing about itthey are supported by a large cast of talented actors some of whom do great work ty mitchell is excellent as john a poor man drawn into emmet and king hales plans who has more dignity then the both of them combined jesse plemons does typically fine work as fbi man tom white while louis cancelmi is seedily slick as kelsie morrison a stooge of king hales on the other hand the likes of cara jade myers as mollies alcoholic sister and brendan fraser in a thankfully small role as king hales lawyer are both so miscast and over the top they distract from everything going on around themits a sad indictment of a film when its central message was summed up more succinctly in a dean martin song the money song from  them that have it get more of it the less they need it the more they love it such is the thesis of the film greed spreads like a plague and the richer you are the greedier you are its not original nor is it profound this very same tale was told much more impactfully back in  in mervyn leroys the fbi storyat the end of the day killers of the flower moon is a truncated adaptation of a great nonfiction book overlong and devoid of any original or meaningful message despite

2351,"the holdovers (2023)","american fiction is a smart and well-crafted film, an absolute must-see","kevinrobbins","american fiction is a comedy drama film written and directed by cord jefferson based on the novel erasure by percival everett starring jeffrey wright in the lead role it stands as one of the best written most damning satires about racial stereotypes to hit movie screens in a very long timein los angeles literature professor thelonious monk ellison jeffrey wright is placed on mandatory leave by his university after frequently arguing with his students over differing opinions on racial issues wishing to spend this time off with his family monk travels to boston to meet up with them and later decides to attend a literary seminar taking place nearby monks qa panel receives very little attention due to most of the attendees choosing instead to watch an onstage interview with author sintara golden issa rae whose novel wes lives in da ghetto has become a number one bestseller surprised at how much sintaras book panders to african american stereotypes yet receives such glowing praise from readers monk decides to write his own novel in the exact same style titling it my pafology and loading it up with every cliche imaginable for a black writer under the pen name stagg r leigh monk sends his completed novel to various publishers out of spite and is soon shocked to discover that he is now being offered  and a movie deal for the rights to his storyit can be difficult for creative people to compromise their vision for the sake of pandering to others all too often many writers artists performers and other similar folk are at the mercy of company executives forcing them to make changes to their work as a result of wishing to keep up with the times of course this can yield mixed results as while the creators in question will likely profit greatly from their amended product a major part of their true selves may have been severely altered in the process this is especially the case with the current political climate with many people being forcibly made to acquiesce to modern views on race sexuality and gender identity whether they agree with any of it or not the film american fiction is an excellent example of how it is possible to satirise the worlds view on stereotypes without once resorting to sensationalism or condescensionfrom the very opening scene you can immediately tell what direction this movie is going to take with its satirical point of view we watch as monk a well educated african american university scholar has an argument with one of his white female students regarding the title of a book he is teaching the class the book in question whose title contains a racial slur offends the young student with hair dyed neon green prompting her to question why he isnt offended along with her monk tells the student that if he is capable of understanding the proper context of what is being taught then she can as well which he soon learns the hard way is not the case at all the scathing yet humorous look at the way modern teachers have to deal with these types of students especially from an african american perspective is one of the many reasons this movie works as well as it does this is because it allows the audience to see the hypocrisy of virtue signalling which calls attention to the subconscious racism on display by the very ones who claim to be against itlater on when monk writes his book we watch as he dumbs down every element of his otherwise intelligent storytelling technique gone is his sophisticated writing style and in its place is the stereotypical african american street vernacular spoken by violent gunwielding criminals as the main characters coming from a man with such a highly educated background it becomes obvious to the viewer that it is a painful experience for monk to compromise what could have been a clever indepth story about two black friends but he forcefully presses on to prove his point about pandering to his surprise monks experiment works a little too well and he finds himself offered a large sum of money just for the publishing rights alone on that note perhaps the best way to describe this film is that its like a combination of mel brookss the producers and spike lees blackkklansman as each involve some kind of deceptive plan that goes horribly right for the protagonistin addition to the sharply satirical humour woven throughout the story the film also has its fair share of deeply emotional moments primarily shown through members of monks immediate family although it is shown that monk had a respectable upbringing his family has still been subjected to various ups and downs that have essentially shaped him into the person he is today for instance his mother agnes leslie uggams suffers from early stages of alzheimers disease causing her to forget most of the great achievements he and his other siblings have accomplished throughout their lives because of this monk is forced into an ultimatum move her into an expensive nursing home with his own money or let his siblings sort things out for a cheaper pricealso monks estranged brother cliff sterling k brown has been living a hedonistic lifestyle after divorcing his wife frequently engaging in drug use and sexual encounters we later see that cliff whose divorce was the result of him coming out as gay is now at odds with agnes due to her homophobic views on family values putting a strain on his relationship with her i was highly impressed with the way director cord jefferson was able to juggle all of monks family issues so smoothly while simultaneously keeping the core satirical elements at the forefront of the story most first time filmmakers would greatly falter in this department but jefferson strikes the perfect balance between darkly comical and touchingly dramatic without ever using cheap jokes or unearned sentimentality to get the point acrossin his best film performance to date jeffrey wright does a fantastic job in the role of monk several times throughout the film we witness monk react to all of the bizarre sometimes frustrating things that end up happening to him and wrights facial expressions and body language certainly shine during these scenes in the previously mentioned opening its easy to understand how irritated monk must be at dealing with socially ignorant people like his offended student and the repressed annoyance he shows is both funny and relatable just by the level of self control he has during this situation ive always found wright to be an underrated actor who has never become a household name despite starring in several on screen productions over the years so its nice to see him finally receive some mainstream acknowledgement for his work in this filmworth mentioning as well is sterling k brown as cliff monks estranged homosexual younger brother what i liked most about cliff as a character is the way in which he acts as a reminder to monk of the importance of staying true to himself in one scene which i wont discuss in too much detail due to spoilers we see cliff and monk talking about the long term impact of doing things to appease others rather than yourself this introspective chat about living life your own way is among the most emotionally affecting parts of the film and brown definitely holds his own alongside wright during this particular moment you are really given the sense that these two brothers now share a common ground despite all of their past disagreementstaking into account its timely subject matter cord jeffersons american fiction stands triumphantly as one of the cleverest funniest satirical films to be released in many years its so rare to see a brand new filmmaker get everything right on their first try while at the same time create something that has the potential to be a talking point for generations to come of course jefferson could not have accomplished any of this without the help of the films cast whom he has given them all great material to work with thanks to his excellent screenplay with all that said jefferson has now established himself as a filmmaker to watch and i eagerly await any future projects he may have on the horizoni rate it a very high ","17 january 2024","8/10",2024-01-17,NA

based on the novel erasure by percival everett starring jeffrey wright in the lead role it stands as one of the best written most damning satires about racial stereotypes to hit movie screens in a very long timein los angeles literature professor thelonious monk ellison jeffrey wright is placed on mandatory leave by his university after frequently arguing with his students over differing opinions on racial issues wishing to spend this time off with his family monk travels to boston to meet up with them and later decides to attend a literary seminar taking place nearby monks qa panel receives very little attention due to most of the attendees choosing instead to watch an onstage interview with author sintara golden issa rae whose novel wes lives in da ghetto has become a number one bestseller surprised at how much sintaras book panders to african american stereotypes yet receives such glowing praise from readers monk decides to write his own novel in the exact same style titling it my pafology and loading it up with every cliche imaginable for a black writer under the pen name stagg r leigh monk sends his completed novel to various publishers out of spite and is soon shocked to discover that he is now being offered  and a movie deal for the rights to his storyit can be difficult for creative people to compromise their vision for the sake of pandering to others all too often many writers artists performers and other similar folk are at the mercy of company executives forcing them to make changes to their work as a result of wishing to keep up with the times of course this can yield mixed results as while the creators in question will likely profit greatly from their amended product a major part of their true selves may have been severely altered in the process this is especially the case with the current political climate with many people being forcibly made to acquiesce to modern views on race sexuality and gender identity whether they agree with any of it or not the film american fiction is an excellent example of how it is possible to satirise the worlds view on stereotypes without once resorting to sensationalism or condescensionfrom the very opening scene you can immediately tell what direction this movie is going to take with its satirical point of view we watch as monk a well educated african american university scholar has an argument with one of his white female students regarding the title of a book he is teaching the class the book in question whose title contains a racial slur offends the young student with hair dyed neon green prompting her to question why he isnt offended along with her monk tells the student that if he is capable of understanding the proper context of what is being taught then she can as well which he soon learns the hard way is not the case at all the scathing yet humorous look at the way modern teachers have to deal with these types of students especially from an african american perspective is one of the many reasons this movie works as well as it does this is because it allows the audience to see the hypocrisy of virtue signalling which calls attention to the subconscious racism on display by the very ones who claim to be against itlater on when monk writes his book we watch as he dumbs down every element of his otherwise intelligent storytelling technique gone is his sophisticated writing style and in its place is the stereotypical african american street vernacular spoken by violent gunwielding criminals as the main characters coming from a man with such a highly educated background it becomes obvious to the viewer that it is a painful experience for monk to compromise what could have been a clever indepth story about two black friends but he forcefully presses on to prove his point about pandering to his surprise monks experiment works a little too well and he finds himself offered a large sum of money just for the publishing rights alone on that note perhaps the best way to describe this film is that its like a combination of mel brookss the producers and spike lees blackkklansman as each involve some kind of deceptive plan that goes horribly right for the protagonistin addition to the sharply satirical humour woven throughout the story the film also has its fair share of deeply emotional moments primarily shown through members of monks immediate family although it is shown that monk had a respectable upbringing his family has still been subjected to various ups and downs that have essentially shaped him into the person he is today for instance his mother agnes leslie uggams suffers from early stages of alzheimers disease causing her to forget most of the great achievements he and his other siblings have accomplished throughout their lives because of this monk is forced into an ultimatum move her into an expensive nursing home with his own money or let his siblings sort things out for a cheaper pricealso monks estranged brother cliff sterling k brown has been living a hedonistic lifestyle after divorcing his wife frequently engaging in drug use and sexual encounters we later see that cliff whose divorce was the result of him coming out as gay is now at odds with agnes due to her homophobic views on family values putting a strain on his relationship with her i was highly impressed with the way director cord jefferson was able to juggle all of monks family issues so smoothly while simultaneously keeping the core satirical elements at the forefront of the story most first time filmmakers would greatly falter in this department but jefferson strikes the perfect balance between darkly comical and touchingly dramatic without ever using cheap jokes or unearned sentimentality to get the point acrossin his best film performance to date jeffrey wright does a fantastic job in the role of monk several times throughout the film we witness monk react to all of the bizarre sometimes frustrating things that end up happening to him and wrights facial expressions and body language certainly shine during these scenes in the previously mentioned opening its easy to understand how irritated monk must be at dealing with socially ignorant people like his offended student and the repressed annoyance he shows is both funny and relatable just by the level of self control he has during this situation ive always found wright to be an underrated actor who has never become a household name despite starring in several on screen productions over the years so its nice to see him finally receive some mainstream acknowledgement for his work in this filmworth mentioning as well is sterling k brown as cliff monks estranged homosexual younger brother what i liked most about cliff as a character is the way in which he acts as a reminder to monk of the importance of staying true to himself in one scene which i wont discuss in too much detail due to spoilers we see cliff and monk talking about the long term impact of doing things to appease others rather than yourself this introspective chat about living life your own way is among the most emotionally affecting parts of the film and brown definitely holds his own alongside wright during this particular moment you are really given the sense that these two brothers now share a common ground despite all of their past disagreementstaking into account its timely subject matter cord jeffersons american fiction stands triumphantly as one of the cleverest funniest satirical films to be released in many years its so rare to see a brand new filmmaker get everything right on their first try while at the same time create something that has the potential to be a talking point for generations to come of course jefferson could not have accomplished any of this without the help of the films cast whom he has given them all great material to work with thanks to his excellent screenplay with all that said jefferson has now established himself as a filmmaker to watch and i eagerly await any future projects he may have on the horizoni rate it a very high ","17 january 2024","8/10",2024-01-17,NA

racism on display by the very ones who claim to be against itlater on when monk writes his book we watch as he dumbs down every element of his otherwise intelligent storytelling technique gone is his sophisticated writing style and in its place is the stereotypical african american street vernacular spoken by violent gunwielding criminals as the main characters coming from a man with such a highly educated background it becomes obvious to the viewer that it is a painful experience for monk to compromise what could have been a clever indepth story about two black friends but he forcefully presses on to prove his point about pandering to his surprise monks experiment works a little too well and he finds himself offered a large sum of money just for the publishing rights alone on that note perhaps the best way to describe this film is that its like a combination of mel brookss the producers and spike lees blackkklansman as each involve some kind of deceptive plan that goes horribly right for the protagonistin addition to the sharply satirical humour woven throughout the story the film also has its fair share of deeply emotional moments primarily shown through members of monks immediate family although it is shown that monk had a respectable upbringing his family has still been subjected to various ups and downs that have essentially shaped him into the person he is today for instance his mother agnes leslie uggams suffers from early stages of alzheimers disease causing her to forget most of the great achievements he and his other siblings have accomplished throughout their lives because of this monk is forced into an ultimatum move her into an expensive nursing home with his own money or let his siblings sort things out for a cheaper pricealso monks estranged brother cliff sterling k brown has been living a hedonistic lifestyle after divorcing his wife frequently engaging in drug use and sexual encounters we later see that cliff whose divorce was the result of him coming out as gay is now at odds with agnes due to her homophobic views on family values putting a strain on his relationship with her i was highly impressed with the way director cord jefferson was able to juggle all of monks family issues so smoothly while simultaneously keeping the core satirical elements at the forefront of the story most first time filmmakers would greatly falter in this department but jefferson strikes the perfect balance between darkly comical and touchingly dramatic without ever using cheap jokes or unearned sentimentality to get the point acrossin his best film performance to date jeffrey wright does a fantastic job in the role of monk several times throughout the film we witness monk react to all of the bizarre sometimes frustrating things that end up happening to him and wrights facial expressions and body language certainly shine during these scenes in the previously mentioned opening its easy to understand how irritated monk must be at dealing with socially ignorant people like his offended student and the repressed annoyance he shows is both funny and relatable just by the level of self control he has during this situation ive always found wright to be an underrated actor who has never become a household name despite starring in several on screen productions over the years so its nice to see him finally receive some mainstream acknowledgement for his work in this filmworth mentioning as well is sterling k brown as cliff monks estranged homosexual younger brother what i liked most about cliff as a character is the way in which he acts as a reminder to monk of the importance of staying true to himself in one scene which i wont discuss in too much detail due to spoilers we see cliff and monk talking about the long term impact of doing things to appease others rather than yourself this introspective chat about living life your own way is among the most emotionally affecting parts of the film and brown definitely holds his own alongside wright during this particular moment you are really given the sense that these two brothers now share a common ground despite all of their past disagreementstaking into account its timely subject matter cord jeffersons american fiction stands triumphantly as one of the cleverest funniest satirical films to be released in many years its so rare to see a brand new filmmaker get everything right on their first try while at the same time create something that has the potential to be a talking point for generations to come of course jefferson could not have accomplished any of this without the help of the films cast whom he has given them all great material to work with thanks to his excellent screenplay with all that said jefferson has now established himself as a filmmaker to watch and i eagerly await any future projects he may have on the horizoni rate it a very high ","17 january 2024","8/10",2024-01-17,NA

opinions on racial issues wishing to spend this time off with his family monk travels to boston to meet up with them and later decides to attend a literary seminar taking place nearby monks qa panel receives very little attention due to most of the attendees choosing instead to watch an onstage interview with author sintara golden issa rae whose novel wes lives in da ghetto has become a number one bestseller surprised at how much sintaras book panders to african american stereotypes yet receives such glowing praise from readers monk decides to write his own novel in the exact same style titling it my pafology and loading it up with every cliche imaginable for a black writer under the pen name stagg r leigh monk sends his completed novel to various publishers out of spite and is soon shocked to discover that he is now being offered  and a movie deal for the rights to his storyit can be difficult for creative people to compromise their vision for the sake of pandering to others all too often many writers artists performers and other similar folk are at the mercy of company executives forcing them to make changes to their work as a result of wishing to keep up with the times of course this can yield mixed results as while the creators in question will likely profit greatly from their amended product a major part of their true selves may have been severely altered in the process this is especially the case with the current political climate with many people being forcibly made to acquiesce to modern views on race sexuality and gender identity whether they agree with any of it or not the film american fiction is an excellent example of how it is possible to satirise the worlds view on stereotypes without once resorting to sensationalism or condescensionfrom the very opening scene you can immediately tell what direction this movie is going to take with its satirical point of view we watch as monk a well educated african american university scholar has an argument with one of his white female students regarding the title of a book he is teaching the class the book in question whose title contains a racial slur offends the young student with hair dyed neon green prompting her to question why he isnt offended along with her monk tells the student that if he is capable of understanding the proper context of what is being taught then she can as well

2391,"the holdovers (2023)","american fiction is a smart and well-crafted film, an absolute must-see","kevinrobbins","american fiction is a comedy drama film written and directed by cord jefferson based on the novel erasure by percival everett starring jeffrey wright in the lead role it stands as one of the best written most damning satires about racial stereotypes to hit movie screens in a very long timein los angeles literature professor thelonious monk ellison jeffrey wright is placed on mandatory leave by his university after frequently arguing with his students over differing opinions on racial issues wishing to spend this time off with his family monk travels to boston to meet up with them and later decides to attend a literary seminar taking place nearby monks qa panel receives very little attention due to most of the attendees choosing instead to watch an onstage interview with author sintara golden issa rae whose novel wes lives in da ghetto has become a number one bestseller surprised at how much sintaras book panders to african american stereotypes yet receives such glowing praise from readers monk decides to write his own novel in the exact same style titling it my pafology and loading it up with every cliche imaginable for a black writer under the pen name stagg r leigh monk sends his completed novel to various publishers out of spite and is soon shocked to discover that he is now being offered  and a movie deal for the rights to his storyit can be difficult for creative people to compromise their vision for the sake of pandering to others all too often many writers artists performers and other similar folk are at the mercy of company executives forcing them to make changes to their work as a result of wishing to keep up with the times of course this can yield mixed results as while the creators in question will likely profit greatly from their amended product a major part of their true selves may have been severely altered in the process this is especially the case with the current political climate with many people being forcibly made to acquiesce to modern views on race sexuality and gender identity whether they agree with any of it or not the film american fiction is an excellent example of how it is possible to satirise the worlds view on stereotypes without once resorting to sensationalism or condescensionfrom the very opening scene you can immediately tell what direction this movie is going to take with its satirical point of view we watch as monk a well educated african american university scholar has an argument with one of his white female students regarding the title of a book he is teaching the class the book in question whose title contains a racial slur offends the young student with hair dyed neon green prompting her to question why he isnt offended along with her monk tells the student that if he is capable of understanding the proper context of what is being taught then she can as well which he soon learns the hard way is not the case at all the scathing yet humorous look at the way modern teachers have to deal with these types of students especially from an african american perspective is one of the many reasons this movie works as well as it does this is because it allows the audience to see the hypocrisy of virtue signalling which calls attention to the subconscious racism on display by the very ones who claim to be against itlater on when monk writes his book we watch as he dumbs down every element of his otherwise intelligent storytelling technique gone is his sophisticated writing style and in its place is the stereotypical african american street vernacular spoken by violent gunwielding criminals as the main characters coming from a man with such a highly educated background it becomes obvious to the viewer that it is a painful experience for monk to compromise what could have been a clever indepth story about two black friends but he forcefully presses on to prove his point about pandering to his surprise monks experiment works a little too well and he finds himself offered a large sum of money just for the publishing rights alone on that note perhaps the best way to describe this film is that its like a combination of mel brookss the producers and spike lees blackkklansman as each involve some kind of deceptive plan that goes horribly right for the protagonistin addition to the sharply satirical humour woven throughout the story the film also has its fair share of deeply emotional moments primarily shown through members of monks immediate family although it is shown that monk had a respectable upbringing his family has still been subjected to various ups and downs that have essentially shaped him into the person he is today for instance his mother agnes leslie uggams suffers from early stages of alzheimers disease causing her to forget most of the great achievements he and his other siblings have accomplished throughout their lives because of this monk is forced into an ultimatum move her into an expensive nursing home with his own money or let his siblings sort things out for a cheaper pricealso monks estranged brother cliff sterling k brown has been living a hedonistic lifestyle after divorcing his wife frequently engaging in drug use and sexual encounters we later see that cliff whose divorce was the result of him coming out as gay is now at odds with agnes due to her homophobic views on family values putting a strain on his relationship with her i was highly impressed with the way director cord jefferson was able to juggle all of monks family issues so smoothly while simultaneously keeping the core satirical elements at the forefront of the story most first time filmmakers would greatly falter in this department but jefferson strikes the perfect balance between darkly comical and touchingly dramatic without ever using cheap jokes or unearned sentimentality to get the point acrossin his best film performance to date jeffrey wright does a fantastic job in the role of monk several times throughout the film we witness monk react to all of the bizarre sometimes frustrating things that end up happening to him and wrights facial expressions and body language certainly shine during these scenes in the previously mentioned opening its easy to understand how irritated monk must be at dealing with socially ignorant people like his offended student and the repressed annoyance he shows is both funny and relatable just by the level of self control he has during this situation ive always found wright to be an underrated actor who has never become a household name despite starring in several on screen productions over the years so its nice to see him finally receive some mainstream acknowledgement for his work in this filmworth mentioning as well is sterling k brown as cliff monks estranged homosexual younger brother what i liked most about cliff as a character is the way in which he acts as a reminder to monk of the importance of staying true to himself in one scene which i wont discuss in too much detail due to spoilers we see cliff and monk talking about the long term impact of doing things to appease others rather than yourself this introspective chat about living life your own way is among the most emotionally affecting parts of the film and brown definitely holds his own alongside wright during this particular moment you are really given the sense that these two brothers now share a common ground despite all of their past disagreementstaking into account its timely subject matter cord jeffersons american fiction stands triumphantly as one of the cleverest funniest satirical films to be released in many years its so rare to see a brand new filmmaker get everything right on their first try while at the same time create something that has the potential to be a talking point for generations to come of course jefferson could not have accomplished any of this without the help of the films cast whom he has given them all great material to work with thanks to his excellent screenplay with all that said jefferson has now established himself as a filmmaker to watch and i eagerly await any future projects he may have on the horizoni rate it a very high ","17 january 2024","8/10",2024-01-17,NA

2450,"the holdovers (2023)","lol no","chenp","argylle is a disappointingly generic offering from matthew vaughn which does nothing to raise him out of the current slump hes in because up until now hes always been a master at taking familiar plot structures and using them to make a subversive take on tried and tested story tropes he did this for superheroes in kick ass and for the spy genre in the first kingsman movie argylle on the other hand barely has a single original idea in its entire runtime so it just doesnt feel like its doing anything of substance with this fairly familiar story its not only totally uninspired as a viewing experience but also a pretty boring one at thati dont know what happened to the matthew vaughn of old who used to be so good at telling concise focused stories because this yet another film of his that felt massively overindulgent though that may be to light a word to describe just how poorly paced this movie is because almost every single scene in this thing overstays its welcome no matter how many great action scenes and funny moments there were when you drag these moments on for too long they lose almost all of their effectiveness the totally bog standard story doesnt do anything to justify the runtime its given and matthew vaughans serious lack of restraint in editing robs the entire film of any pace or urgencyi wouldnt really say i was that impressed in the writing or visual departments its a pretty bland looking movie overall with some impressive action but a massive overuse of cgi that frequently took me out of the film there are many reasons my the rd act basically collapsed in on itself for me but the horrendous effects were a large part of it it feels like ever since the first kingsman vaughn has been trying to top the now iconic church fight scene to no avail the last act dials of the insanity up to ridiculous levels and in no good way vaughn just throws a series of ludicrous overthetop action sequences in our face backtoback and not only do they fall totally flat they actually made me cringebut like any film other film argylle lives and dies by its script and quite frankly its terrible theres barely a single original idea in this entire film and the whole spystorywithinaspystory gimmick was interesting to begin with but it wore out its welcome pretty quickly for me the whole plot revolves around a standard mcguffin chase a shadowy rogue spy organisation and hints of an amnesia plot weve seen all this  times before and its not used in a way that feels cheekily referential but just frustratingly lazy i had very little investment in the cavill sequences since theyre established as fictional from almost the very start but i also didnt find cavills performance or the character to be that interesting hes written as such a charisma vacuum and thats not something id ever associate cavill with it felt like they just kept forcing the argylle character into the narrative to capitalise on cavills star power rather than because the character warranted repeated inclusion i liked bryce dallas howard and sam rockwell as a pair and they did have good chemistry but some of the twists and turns related to their characters i found to be quite ridiculous honestly and it felt like vaughn was pulling twists out of thin air rather than truly earning themi was truly hoping that argylle would be the return to form for matthew vaughn that ive been waiting for but honestly this might just be the worst film hes ever made for me i liked golden circle more than most but it was still a massive step down from the first the kings man on the other hand was a totally bland slog that never really justified its own existence but neither of those two films matched the level of wasted potential that argylle exhibited for me it just feels like vaughn has totally lost sight of what made him and his films stand out in the first place and this feels like a bare template of a story without anything that makes it feel remotely original or subversive i know its only february but  has already presented one of its biggest cinematic disappointments for me","31 january 2024","3/10",2024-01-31,NA
